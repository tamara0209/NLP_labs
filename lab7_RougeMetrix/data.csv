The Basic Goal In Derandomizationtheory Is To Eliminate Or Reduce The Need For Randomness In Such Randomizedconstructions. In This Thesis, We Explore Some Applications Of The Fundamentalnotions In Derandomization Theory To Problems Outside The Core Of Theoreticalcomputer Science, And In Particular, Certain Problems Related To Coding Theory.  First, We Consider The Wiretap Channel Problem Which Involves A Communicationsystem In Which An Intruder Can Eavesdrop A Limited Portion Of Thetransmissions, And Construct Efficient And Information Theoretically Optimalcommunication Protocols For This Model. Then We Consider The Combinatorialgroup Testing Problem. In This Classical Problem, One Aims To Determine A Setof Defective Items Within A Large Population By Asking A Number Of Queries,where Each Query Reveals Whether A Defective Item Is Present Within A Specifiedgroup Of Items. We Use Randomness Condensers To Explicitly Construct Optimal,or Nearly Optimal, Group Testing Schemes For A Setting Where The Query Outcomescan Be Highly Unreliable, As Well As The Threshold Model Where A Query Returnspositive If The Number Of Defectives Pass A Certain Threshold. Finally, Wedesign Ensembles Of Error Correcting Codes That Achieve Theinformation Theoretic Capacity Of A Large Class Of Communication Channels, Andthen Use The Obtained Ensembles For Construction Of Explicit Capacity Achievingcodes.

Recently It Was Shown That Some Models Of Computation With Real Numberswere Equivalent From A Computability Perspective. In Particular It Was Shownthat Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer  Gpac  Is Equivalent Tocomputable Analysis. However, Little Is Known About What Happens At Acomputational Complexity Level.

The Term Quantum Gravity Itself Is Ambiguous As There Are Manyproposals For Its Correct Formulation And None Of Them Have Been Verifiedexperimentally. In This Thesis We Consider A Number Of Closely Relatedapproaches To Two Dimensional Quantum Gravity That Share The Property That Theymay Be Formulated In Terms Of Random Graphs. In One Such Approach Known Ascausal Dynamical Triangulations, Numerical Computations Suggest An Interestingphenomenon In Which The Effective Spacetime Dimension Is Reduced In The Uv. Inthis Thesis We First Address Whether Such A Dynamical Reduction In The Numberof Dimensions May Be Understood In A Simplified Model. We Introduce A Continuumlimit Where This Simplified Model Exhibits A Reduction In The Effectivedimension Of Spacetime In The Uv, In Addition To Having Rich Cross Overbehaviour.  In The Second Part Of This Thesis We Consider An Approach Closely Related Tocausal Dynamical Triangulation; Namely Dynamical Triangulation. Although Thistheory Is Less Well Behaved Than Causal Dynamical Triangulation, It Is Knownhow To Couple It To Matter, Therefore Allowing For Potentially Multipleboundary States To Appear In The Theory. We Address The Conjecture Of Seibergand Shih Which States That All These Boundary States Are Degenerate And May Beconstructed From A Single Principal Boundary State. By Use Of The Random Graphformulation Of The Theory We Compute The Higher Genus Amplitudes With A Singleboundary And Find That They Violate The Seiberg Shih Conjecture.

Distributional Semantics Presupposes That The Meanings Of Words Area Function Of Their Occurrences In Textual Contexts. It Models Words Asdistributions Over These Contexts And Represents Them As Vectors In Highdimensional Spaces. The Problem Of Compositionality For Such Models Concernsitself With How To Produce Representations For Larger Units Of Text Bycomposing The Representations Of Smaller Units Of Text.  This Thesis Focuses On A Particular Approach To This Compositionalityproblem, Namely Using The Categorical Framework Developed By Coecke, Sadrzadeh,and Clark, Which Combines Syntactic Analysis Formalisms With Distributionalsemantic Representations Of Meaning To Produce Syntactically Motivatedcomposition Operations. This Thesis Shows How This Approach Can Betheoretically Extended And Practically Implemented To Produce Concretecompositional Distributional Models Of Natural Language Semantics. Itfurthermore Demonstrates That Such Models Can Perform On Par With, Or Betterthan, Other Competing Approaches In The Field Of Natural Language Processing.  There Are Three Principal Contributions To Computational Linguistics In Thisthesis. The First Is To Extend The Discocat Framework On The Syntactic Frontand Semantic Front, Incorporating A Number Of Syntactic Analysis Formalisms Andproviding Learning Procedures Allowing For The Generation Of Concretecompositional Distributional Models.

Furthermore, In This Scenario The Gravitino Is Unstableand Might Thus Be Accessible By Indirect Detection Via Its Decay Products.  We Compute In This Thesis The Partial Decay Widths For The Gravitino Inmodels With Bilinear R Parity Breaking. In Addition, We Determine The Neutrinosignal From Astrophysical Gravitino Dark Matter Decays.

Salient Contributions  The Research Presents The Following Salient Contributions   I. A Novel Technique Has Been Developed For Comparing Biographicalinformation, By Combining The Average Impact Of Levenshtein,damerau Levenshtein, And Editor Distances. The Impact Is Calculated As Theratio Of The Edit Distance To The Maximum Possible Edit Distance Between Twostrings Of The Same Lengths As The Given Pair Of Strings. This Impact Lies Inthe Range [0, 1] And Can Easily Be Converted To A Similarity  Matching  Scoreby Subtracting The Impact From Unity.  Ii. A Universal Soft Computing Framework Is Proposed For Adaptively Fusingbiometric And Biographical Information By Making Real Time Decisions Todetermine After Consideration Of Each Individual Identifier Whether Computationof Matching Scores And Subsequent Fusion Of Additional Identifiers, Includingbiographical Information Is Required. This Proposed Framework Not Only Improvesthe Accuracy Of The System By Fusing Less Reliable Information  E.g.biographical Information  Only For Instances Where Such A Fusion Is Required,but Also Improves The Efficiency Of The System By Computing Matching Scores Forvarious Available Identifiers Only When This Computation Is Considerednecessary.

For That Criterion, The Optimaldecision Is The Bayesian Minimum Risk Estimator. However, The Computationalload Of The Bayesian Estimator Is Often Prohibitive And, Hence, Efficientcomputational Schemes Are Required. The Design Of Novel Schemes, Striking Newbalances Between Accuracy And Computational Load, Is The Primary Concern Ofthis Thesis. Two Popular Techniques, One Exact And One Approximate, Will Bestudied.  The Exact Scheme Is A Recursive One, Namely The Generalized Distributive Law Gdl , Whose Purpose Is To Distribute All Operators Across The Conditionallyindependent  Ci  Factors Of The Joint Model, So As To Reduce The Total Numberof Operators Required. In A Novel Theorem Derived In This Thesis, Gdl, Ifapplicable, Will Be Shown To Guarantee Such A Reduction In All Cases. Anassociated Lemma Also Quantifies This Reduction. For Practical Use, Two Novelalgorithms, Namely The No Longer Needed  Nln  Algorithm And The Generalizedform Of The Markovian Forward Backward  Fb  Algorithm, Recursively Factorizesand Computes The Ci Factors Of An Arbitrary Model, Respectively.

The Model We Consider Is The Dqc1 Or `power Of One Qubit'model. I Show That There Is Minimal Bipartite Entanglement In A Typicalinstance Of The Dqc1 Circuit And Even Put An Upper Bound On The Possible Amountof Entanglement. This Limited Amount Of Entanglement, However, Does Not Implythat The System Is Classically Simulatable. A Matrix Product State  Mps Algorithm For A Typical Instance Of The Dqc1 System Requires Exponentialclassical Resources. This Exposes A Gap Between The Amount Of Entanglement Andthe Amount Of Purely Nonclassical Correlations In A Quantum System. This Gap, Isuggest, Can Be Filled By Quantum Discord. I Calculate It In A Typical Instanceof The Dqc1 Circuit And Find That The Amount Of Discord Is A Constant Fractionof The Maximum Possible Discord For A System Of That Size. This Allows Aninterpretation Of Quantum Discord As The Resource That Drives Mixed Statequantum Computation. I Also Study Quantum Discord As A Quantity Of Independentinterest. Its Role In The Phenomenon Of Entanglement Distribution Is Studiedthrough An Easily Comprehensible Example.  This Thesis Also Contains Discussions On The Relation Between The Complexityclasses P, Bqp And Dqc1.

This Setting Is More Realistic Thanthe Classical Frechet Distance Setting, Specially In Gis Applications. We Alsostudy This Problem In The Setting Where The Polygonal Curves Are Inside Asimple Polygon.  In The Second Part Of This Thesis, We Present A Data Structure, Called Thefree Space Map, That Enables Us To Solve Several Variants Of The Frechetdistance Problem Efficiently. Our Data Structure Encapsulates All Theinformation Available In The Free Space Diagram, Yet It Is Capable Of Answeringmore General Type Of Queries Efficiently. Given That The Free Space Map Has Thesame Size And Construction Time As The Standard Free Space Diagram, It Can Beviewed As A Powerful Alternative To It. As Part Of The Results In Part Ii Ofthe Thesis, We Exploit The Free Space Map To Improve The Long Standing Boundfor Computing The Partial Frechet Distance And Obtain Improved Algorithms Forcomputing The Frechet Distance Between Two Closed Curves, And The So Calledminimum Maximum Walk Problem.

Oneapproach To Overcome This Problem Is To Use The Notion Of Data Depth Whichmeasures The Centrality Of A Point With Respect To A Given Data Set. In Otherwords, A Data Depth Can Be Applied To Indicate How Deep A Point Is Located Withrespect To A Given Data Set. Using Data Depth, A Multivariate Order Can Bedefined By Ordering The Data Points According To Their Depth Values. Variousnotions Of Data Depth Have Been Introduced Over The Last Decades.

In This Thesis, It Is Shown How Analytical Solutions Of The Blochequation Can Be Found, Which Promise Substantial Execution Time Advantages Overnumerical Solution Methods. From These Analytical Solutions Of The Blochequation, A New Formalism For The Description And The Analysis Of Compleximaging Experiments Is Derived, The K T Formalism. It Is Shown That Modernimaging Methods Can Be Better Explained By The K T Formalism Than By Observingand Analysing The Magnetization Of Each Spin Of A Spin Ensemble. Variousapproaches For A Numerical Simulation Of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Arediscussed. It Is Shown That A Simulation Tool Based On The K T Formalismpromises A Substantial Gain In Execution Time. Proper Spatial Discretizationaccording To The Sampling Theorem, A Topic Rarely Discussed In Literature, Isuniversally Derived From The K T Formalism In This Thesis. A Spin Basedsimulator Is An Application With High Demands To Computing Facilities Even Onmodern Hardware. In This Thesis, Two Approaches For A Parallelized Softwarearchitecture Are Designed, Analysed And Evaluated With Regard To A Reduction Ofexecution Time.

After The Trading, What Is Left Is A Gauge Theory Invariantunder 3d Diffeomorphisms And Conformal Transformations That Preserve The Volumeof Space. The Local Canonical Constraints Are Linear And The Constraint Algebracloses With Structure Constants. Shape Dynamics, Thus, Provides A Novel Newstarting Point For Quantum Gravity.  The Procedure For The Trading Of Symmetries Was Inspired By A Techniquecalled ""best Matching"". We Explain Best Matching And Its Relation To Mach'sprinciples. The Key Features Of Best Matching Are Illustrated Through Finitedimensional Toy Models. A General Picture Is Then Established Where Relationaltheories Are Treated As Gauge Theories On Configuration Space. Shape Dynamicsis Then Constructed By Applying Best Matching To Conformal Geometry. We Thenstudy Shape Dynamics In More Detail By Computing Its Hamiltonian Andhamilton Jacobi Functional Perturbatively.

This Elusive Particle, Predicted To Exist In1937, Has Been Sought After For Both Fundamental And Practical Reasons. On Thefundamental Level, No Particle To Date Has Been Observed To Be A Majoranafermion, Meanwhile On The Practical Level A Majorana Fermion, If Found, Wouldrepresent A Non Abelian Anyon And Could Thus Be Used To Build A Quantumcomputer. The Search For A Majorana Fermion Has Recently Shifted To Topologicalsuperconductivity. Topological Superconductors Are Categorized By Thenontrivial Wind  Ing Of Their Order Parameter Phase And For This Reason Areexpected To Support Majorana Fermions In Their Vortex Cores. Owing To This, Thestudy Of Topological Superconductors Has Intensified In Recent Years. Currentproposals For A Device That May Behave As A Topological Superconductor Arebased On Semiconductor Heterostructures, Where The Spin Orbit Coupled Bands Ofa Semiconductor Are Split By A Band Gap Or Zeeman Field And Superconductivityis Induced By Proximity To A Conventional Superconductor. In This Setup,topological Superconductivity Is Obtained In The Semiconductor Layer And Theproposed Heterostructures Typically Include Two Or Three Layers Of Differentmaterials. In This Thesis We Propose A Simplification To These Types Ofdevices, Suggesting A Way In Which The Superconducting Layer Can Be Replaced.part Of Our Proposal Includes A Model Hamiltonian For These Types Of Systems.this Thesis Will Also Develop Several Different Methods To Analyze This Modelhamiltonian In Various Different Parameter Regimes With The Ultimate Goal Ofclassifying Its Topology.;Aaron Farrell;cond-mat.supr-con;"A M.

In This Thesis Suchclassification Is Generalized To Manifolds Of Arbitrary Dimension Andsignature. This Is Accomplished By Interpreting The Weyl Tensor As A Linearoperator On The Bundle Of P Forms, For Any P, And Computing The Jordancanonical Form Of This Operator. Throughout This Work The Spaces Are Assumed Tobe Complexified, So That Different Signatures Correspond To Different Realityconditions, Providing A Unified Treatment. A Higher Dimensional Generalizationof The So Called Self Dual Manifolds Is Also Investigated.  The Most Important Result Related To The Petrov Classification Is Thegoldberg Sachs Theorem. Here Are Presented Two Partial Generalizations Of Suchtheorem Valid In Even Dimensional Manifolds. One Of These Generalizationsstates That Certain Algebraic Constraints On The Weyl Operator Imply Theexistence Of An Integrable Maximally Isotropic Distribution. The Other Versionof The Generalized Goldberg Sachs Theorem States That These Algebraicconstraints Imply The Existence Of A Null Congruence Whose Optical Scalars Obeyspecial Restrictions.  On The Pursuit Of These Results The Spinorial Formalism In 6 Dimensions Wasdeveloped From The Very Beginning, Using Group Representation Theory. Since Thespinors Are Full Of Geometric Significance And Are Suitable Tools To Deal Withisotropic Structures, It Should Not Come As A Surprise That They Provide Afruitful Framework To Investigate The Issues Treated On This Thesis. Inparticular, The Generalizations Of The Goldberg Sachs Theorem Acquire Anelegant Form In Terms Of The Pure Spinors.;Carlos Batista;gr-qc;"Thesis work, 145 pages.

To Achieve That, Several Sensorslike Radars, Lidars And Cameras Are Installed In Autonomous Vehicles. Theproduced Sensor Data Is Fused To A General Representation Of The Surrounding.in This Thesis The Dynamic Occupancy Grid Map Approach Of Nuss Et Al. Is Usedwhile Three Goals Are Achieved. First, The Approach Of Nuss Et Al. Todistinguish Between Moving And Non Moving Obstacles Is Improved By Using Fullyconvolutional Neural Networks To Create A Class Prediction For Each Grid Cell.for This Purpose, The Network Is Initialized With Public Pre Trained Networkmodels And The Training Is Executed With A Semi Automatic Generated Dataset.the Second Goal Is To Provide Orientation Information For Each Detected Movingobstacle. This Could Improve Tracking Algorithms, Which Are Based On Thedynamic Occupancy Grid Map. The Orientation Extraction Based On Theconvolutional Neural Network Shows A Better Performance In Comparison To Anorientation Extraction Directly Over The Velocity Information Of The Dynamicoccupancy Grid Map. A General Problem Of Developing Machine Learning Approacheslike Neural Networks Is The Number Of Labeled Data, Which Can Always Beincreased. For This Reason, The Last Goal Is To Evaluate A Semi Supervisedlearning Algorithm, To Generate Automatically More Labeled Data. The Result Ofthis Evaluation Shows That The Automated Labeled Data Does Not Improve Theperformance Of The Convolutional Neural Network.

Historically, Time, Frequency Andmore Recently, Spatial Dimensions Have Been Used To Improve Capacity Androbustness. Paradoxically, Radiocommunications That Leverage The Polarizationdimension Have Not Evolved At The Same Pace. In Particular, Thesecommunications Are Widely Used By Satellites, Where Several Streams Aremultiplexed In Each Orthogonal Polarization. Current Communication Trendsadvocate For Simplifying And Unifying Different Frameworks In Order To Increaseflexibility And Address Future Needs. Due To This, Systems That Do Not Requirechannel Information Are Progressively Gaining Traction. This Dissertation Aimsat Challenging This Perspective And Promoting The Use Of Polarization In Newradiocommunication Systems. Consequently, The Goal Of This Thesis Is Twofold First, We Aim At Increasing The Current Capacity Of Point To Point Andpoint To Multipoint Links. Secondly, We Introduce New Mechanisms To Increasethe Robustness Of Communications In Particularly Hostile Environments. In Thiscontext, This Thesis Advocates For The Use Of Polarization As A Dimension To Beexploited In Radiocommunications. In Addition To The Use Of Polarization, Indexmodulations Help Increase Transmission Rates Whilst Improving Robustnessagainst Errors And Imperfections With A Low Computational Complexity. Thus, Thestudy Of Polarization In These Systems Is Essential. This Dissertation Exploresprimordial Aspects In This Area, Such As Channel Capacity, Transmitter Andreceiver Design And Performance Benchmarking With Current Systems.

This Regularisation Usually Is Adiscretisation, Which Makes It Necessary To Give Up Some Paradigms Orsymmetries Of Continuum Physics.  Causal Dynamical Triangulations Regularises The Path Integral Through Asimplicial Discretisation That Introduces A Preferred Time Foliation.

Specifically, We Focused Oncontextual Variation Based On Thematic Restrictions. To Accomplish Theobjectives Of This Doctoral Thesis, We Conducted An Empirical Study Consistingof The Analysis Of A Set Of Contextually Variable Concepts And The Creation Ofa Flexible Definition For Two Of Them.

The Main Result Ofthis Thesis Is An Algorithm To Compute Rational Transformations Of Differentialequations Of Feynman Integrals Into A Canonical Form. Apart From Requiring Theexistence Of Such A Rational Transformation, The Algorithm Needs No Furtherassumptions About The Differential Equation. In Particular, It Is Applicable Toproblems Depending On Multiple Kinematic Variables And Also Allows For Arational Dependence On The Dimensional Regulator. First, The Transformation Lawis Expanded In The Dimensional Regulator To Derive Differential Equations Forthe Coefficients Of The Transformation. Using An Ansatz In Terms Of Rationalfunctions, These Differential Equations Are Then Solved To Determine Thetransformation. This Thesis Also Presents An Implementation Of The Algorithm Inthe Mathematica Package Canonica, Which Is The First Publicly Available Programto Compute Transformations To A Canonical Form For Differential Equationsdepending On Multiple Variables. The Main Functionality And Its Usage Areillustrated With Some Simple Examples. Furthermore, The Package Is Applied Tostate Of The Art Integral Topologies Appearing In Recent Multi Loopcalculations. These Topologies Depend On Up To Three Variables And Includepreviously Unknown Topologies Contributing To Higher Order Corrections To Thecross Section Of Single Top Quark Production At The Lhc.;Christoph Meyer;hep-ph;Ph.D. thesis;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02419v1.pdf;./files/AlgorithmicTransformationOfMultiLoopFeynmanIntegralsToACanonicalBasis.pdf

In The First Part Of This Thesis, We Present Two Methods For Approximatelysolving Large Scale Sum Of Squares Programs That Dispense Altogether Withsemidefinite Programming And Only Involve Solving A Sequence Of Linear Orsecond Order Cone Programs Generated In An Adaptive Fashion. We Then Focus Onthe Problem Of Finding Tight Lower Bounds On Polynomial Optimization Problems Pops , A Fundamental Task In This Area That Is Most Commonly Handled Throughthe Use Of Sdp Based Sum Of Squares Hierarchies  E.g., Due To Lasserre Andparrilo . In Contrast To Previous Approaches, We Provide The First Theoreticalframework For Constructing Converging Hierarchies Of Lower Bounds On Pops Whosecomputation Simply Requires The Ability To Multiply Certain Fixed Polynomialstogether And To Check Nonnegativity Of The Coefficients Of Their Product.  In The Second Part Of This Thesis, We Focus On The Theory And Applications Ofthe Problem Of Optimizing Over Convex Polynomials, A Subcase Of The Problem Ofoptimizing Over Nonnegative Polynomials.

However, Reading Medical Images Andmaking Diagnosis Or Treatment Recommendations Require Specially Trained Medicalspecialists. The Current Practice Of Reading Medical Images Is Labor Intensive,time Consuming, Costly, And Error Prone. It Would Be More Desirable To Have Acomputer Aided System That Can Automatically Make Diagnosis And Treatmentrecommendations. Recent Advances In Deep Learning Enable Us To Rethink The Waysof Clinician Diagnosis Based On Medical Images. In This Thesis, We Willintroduce 1  Mammograms For Detecting Breast Cancers, The Most Frequentlydiagnosed Solid Cancer For U.s. Women, 2  Lung Ct Images For Detecting Lungcancers, The Most Frequently Diagnosed Malignant Cancer, And 3  Head And Neckct Images For Automated Delineation Of Organs At Risk In Radiotherapy. First,we Will Show How To Employ The Adversarial Concept To Generate The Hardexamples Improving Mammogram Mass Segmentation. Second, We Will Demonstrate Howto Use The Weakly Labeled Data For The Mammogram Breast Cancer Diagnosis Byefficiently Design Deep Learning For Multi Instance Learning.

Therefore, It Is A Natural Questionwhat Information Theoretic Primitives Or Computational Assumptions Oblivioustransfer Can Be Based On.  The Results In Our Thesis Are Threefold. First, We Present A Protocol Thatimplements Oblivious Transfer From A Weakened Oblivious Transfer Calleduniversal Oblivious Transfer, Where One Of The Two Players May Get Additionalinformation. Our Reduction Is About Twice As Efficient As Previous Results.  Weak Oblivious Transfer Is An Even Weaker Form Of Oblivious Transfer, Whereboth Players May Obtain Additional Information About The Other Player's Input,and Where The Output Can Contain Errors. We Give A New, Weaker Definition Ofweak Oblivious Transfer, As Well As New Reductions With A More Detailedanalysis.

We Introduce The Rewriting Calculus, Also Called Therho Calculus, Which Generalizes The First Order Term Rewriting Andlambda Calculus, And Makes Possible The Representation Of The Non Determinism.in Our Approach The Abstraction Operator As Well As The Application Operatorare Objects Of Calculus. The Result Of A Reduction In The Rewriting Calculus Iseither An Empty Set Representing The Application Failure, Or A Singletonrepresenting A Deterministic Result, Or A Set Having Several Elementsrepresenting A Not Deterministic Choice Of Results.  In This Thesis We Concentrate On The Properties Of The Rewriting Calculuswhere A Syntactic Matching Is Used In Order To Bind The Variables To Theircurrent Values. We Define Evaluation Strategies Ensuring The Confluence Of Thecalculus And We Show That These Strategies Become Trivial For Restrictions Ofthe General Rewriting Calculus To Simpler Calculi Like The Lambda Calculus. Therewriting Calculus Is Not Terminating In The Untyped Case But The Strongnormalization Is Obtained For The Simply Typed Calculus.  In The Rewriting Calculus Extended With An Operator Allowing To Test Theapplication Failure We Define Terms Representing Innermost And Outermostnormalizations With Respect To A Set Of Rewriting Rules. By Using These Terms,we Obtain A Natural And Concise Description Of The Conditional Rewriting.finally, Starting From The Representation Of The Conditional Rewriting Rules,we Show How The Rewriting Calculus Can Be Used To Give A Semantics To Elan, Alanguage Based On The Application Of Rewriting Rules Controlled By Strategies.;Horatiu Cirstea;cs.SC;PhD Thesis in French;http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011043v1.pdf;./files/RewritingCalculusFoundationsAndApplications.pdf

Indeed, That Period Length Increases Linearly With $n$, Thatis  In Arithmetic Progression. The Fields Have Regulator $o N^2 $. In The Latenineties, These Matters Intrigued Irving Kaplansky, And Led Him To Computeperiod Length Of The Square Root Of Sequences $a^2x^{2n} Bx^{n} C$ For Integers$a$, $b$, $c$, And $x$. In Brief, Kap Found Unsurprisingly That, Generically,triples $ A,b,c $ Are `leapers'  They Yield Sequences With Period Lengthincreasing At Exponential Rate. But There Are Triples Yielding Sequences Withconstant Period Length, Kap's `sleepers'. Finally, There Are Triples, Asexemplified By The Shanks's Sequence, For Which The Period Lengths Increase Inarithmetic Progression. Felicitously, Kaplansky Called These `creepers'.

This Formula Makes Itpossible To Treat Buffer Losses As If They Were Link Losses. Finally, I Studiedcomputer Networks From A Structural Perspective. I Demonstrated Through Fluidsimulations That The Distribution Of Resources, Specifically The Linkbandwidth, Has A Serious Impact On The Global Performance Of The Network. Theni Analyzed The Distribution Of Edge Betweenness In A Growing Scale Free Treeunder The Condition That A Local Property, The In Degree Of The ""younger"" Nodeof An Arbitrary Edge, Is Known In Order To Find An Optimum Distribution Of Linkcapacity.

Its Purpose Is To Provide Various Applications Of Randommatrix Theory, From Algebraic Geometry To Partial Differential Equations Ofintegrable Systems. The Variety Of These Applications Shows Why Matrix Modelsare Important From A Mathematical Point Of View.  First, The Thesis Will Focus On The Study Of The Merging Of Two Intervals Ofthe Eigenvalues Density Near A Singular Point. Specifically, We Will Show Whythis Special Limit Gives Universal Equations From The Painlev\'e Ii Hierarchyof Integrable Systems Theory. Then, Following The Approach Of  Bi  Orthogonalpolynomials Introduced By Mehta To Compute Partition Functions, We Will Findriemann Hilbert And Isomonodromic Problems Connected To Matrix Models, Makingthe Link With The Theory Of Jimbo, Miwa And Ueno. In Particular, We Willdescribe How The Hermitian Two Matrix Models Provide A Degenerate Case Ofjimbo Miwa Ueno's Theory That We Will Generalize In This Context. Furthermore,the Loop Equations Method, With Its Central Notions Of Spectral Curve Andtopological Expansion, Will Lead To The Symplectic Invariants Of Algebraicgeometry Recently Proposed By Eynard And Orantin. This Last Point Will Begeneralized To The Case Of Non Hermitian Matrix Models  Arbitrary $\beta$ Paving The Way To ""quantum Algebraic Geometry"" And To The Generalization Ofsymplectic Invariants To ""quantum Curves"".

Time Observables Are Interesting Quantities In Quantumtheory Because They Often Cannot Be Associated With Self Adjoint Operators.their Definition Therefore Touches On Foundational Issues In Quantum Theory.  Various Operational Approaches To Defining Time Observables Have Beenproposed In The Past. Two Of The Most Common Are Those Based On Pulsedmeasurements In The Form Of Strings Of Projection Operators And Continuousmeasurements In The Form Of Complex Potentials. One Of The Major Achievementsof This Thesis Is To Prove That These Two Operational Approaches Areequivalent.  However Operational Approaches Are Somewhat Unsatisfying By Themselves. Toprovide A Definition Of Time Observables Which Is Not Linked To A Particularmeasurement Scheme We Employ The Decoherent, Or Consistent, Histories Approachto Quantum Theory. We Focus On The Arrival Time, One Particular Example Of Atime Observable, And We Use The Relationship Between Pulsed And Continuousmeasurements To Relate The Decoherent Histories Approach To One Based Oncomplex Potentials. This Lets Us Compute The Arrival Time Probabilitydistribution In Decoherent Histories And We Show That It Agrees Withsemiclassical Expectations In The Right Limit. We Do This Both For A Freeparticle And For A Particle Coupled To An Environment.  Finally, We Consider How The Results Discussed In This Thesis Relate To Thosederived By Coupling A Particle To A Model Clock.

Accordingly, The Goal Of This Thesis Is To Provide An In Depth Analysis Ofrandom Forests, Consistently Calling Into Question Each And Every Part Of Thealgorithm, In Order To Shed New Light On Its Learning Capabilities, Innerworkings And Interpretability. The First Part Of This Work Studies Theinduction Of Decision Trees And The Construction Of Ensembles Of Randomizedtrees, Motivating Their Design And Purpose Whenever Possible. Our Contributionsfollow With An Original Complexity Analysis Of Random Forests, Showing Theirgood Computational Performance And Scalability, Along With An In Depthdiscussion Of Their Implementation Details, As Contributed Within Scikit Learn.  In The Second Part Of This Work, We Analyse And Discuss The Interpretabilityof Random Forests In The Eyes Of Variable Importance Measures. The Core Of Ourcontributions Rests In The Theoretical Characterization Of The Mean Decrease Ofimpurity Variable Importance Measure, From Which We Prove And Derive Some Ofits Properties In The Case Of Multiway Totally Randomized Trees And Inasymptotic Conditions.

We Observe That Under A Change Of Variables,$z_{\text{dt}} X_{\text{ban}} _{\gamma}$ Behaves Formally Like A Borcherds Liftof The Equivariant Elliptic Genus. The Main Result Of This Thesis Is That Theassociated Gromov Witten Potentials $f_{g}$ In Genus $g\geq2$ Are Meromorphicgenus Two Siegel Modular Forms Of Weight $2g 2$. They Arise As Maass Lifts Ofweak Jacobi Forms Of Weight $2g 2$ And Index 1 Arising In An Expansion Of Theelliptic Genus In The Equivariant Parameter. We Show The Equivariant Ellipticgenus Of $\mathbb{c}^{2}$ Encodes The Gopakumar Vafa Invariants Of$x_{\text{ban}}$. Therefore, One Can Regard $x_{\text{ban}}$ As An Examplewhere The Generating Functions Of Gromov Witten And Donaldson Thomas Invariantsin Fiber Classes Are Produced By Standard Lifts Of A Modular Object Encodingthe Gopakumar Vafa Invariants.

In The First Part, We Show Several Exact Mappings Between The Groundstate Of A Trapped Fermi Gas And Ensembles Of Random Matrix Theory. The Fermigas Is Inhomogeneous In The Trapping Potential And In Particular There Is Afinite Edge Beyond Which Its Density Vanishes. Going Beyond Standardsemi Classical Techniques  Such As Local Density Approximation , We Develop Aprecise Description Of The Spatial Statistics Close To The Edge. Thisdescription Holds For A Large Universality Class Of Hard Edge Potentials.

We Obtain For Instance A Completedescription Of The Fluctuations Of The Largest Eigenvalue In The Complexginibre Ensemble.

The Partition Resulting From The Rl Gives Rise Toa Summary, Which Inherits Many Of The Essential Structural Properties Of Theoriginal Graph. We First Extend An Heuristic Version Of The Rl To Improve Itsefficiency And Its Robustness. We Use The Proposed Algorithm To Addressgraph Based Clustering And Image Segmentation Tasks. In The Second Part Of Thethesis, We Introduce A New Heuristic Algorithm Which Is Characterized By Animprovement Of The Summary Quality Both In Terms Of Reconstruction Error And Ofnoise Filtering.

However, Such Success Remains Modest Compared Tohuman Intelligence That Can Learn And Perform An Unlimited Number Of Tasks.humans' Ability Of Learning And Accumulating Knowledge Over Their Lifetime Isan Essential Aspect Of Their Intelligence. Continual Machine Learning Aims At Ahigher Level Of Machine Intelligence Through Providing The Artificial Agentswith The Ability To Learn Online From A Non Stationary And Never Ending Streamof Data. A Key Component Of Such A Never Ending Learning Process Is To Overcomethe Catastrophic Forgetting Of Previously Seen Data, A Problem That Neuralnetworks Are Well Known To Suffer From. The Work Described In This Thesis Hasbeen Dedicated To The Investigation Of Continual Learning And Solutions Tomitigate The Forgetting Phenomena In Neural Networks. To Approach The Continuallearning Problem, We First Assume A Task Incremental Setting Where Tasks Arereceived One At A Time And Data From Previous Tasks Are Not Stored. Since Thetask Incremental Setting Can't Be Assumed In All Continual Learning Scenarios,we Also Study The More General Online Continual Setting. We Consider Aninfinite Stream Of Data Drawn From A Non Stationary Distribution With Asupervisory Or Self Supervisory Training Signal.

A Drawback Of Thisapproach Is That Clauses Are Neither Expressive, Nor Compact, And Using Them Todescribe Decision Problems Can Pose A Big Challenge On Its Own.  We Can Improve This By Using High Level Constraints As A Bridge Between Aproblem At Hand And Sat. Such Constraints Are Then Automatically Translated Toeqisatisfiable Boolean Formulas.

Inspired By This Capability, We Seek To Createa Cognitive Object Perception And Perceptual Learning Architecture That Canlearn 3d Object Categories In An Open Ended Fashion.

The Consequence Is A Newtechnique For Designing And Analysing Probabilistic Structured Predictionmodels. These Results Can Be Applied To Solve Several Complex Learning Problemsincluding But Not Limited To Multi Label Classification, Multi Categoryhierarchical Classification, And Label Ranking.;Shankar Vembu;cs.LG;"PhD thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Bonn

Thepurpose Of This Thesis Is To Extend The Main Ideas Of Classical Networkinformation Theory To The Study Of Classical Quantum Channels. We Prove Codingtheorems For Quantum Multiple Access Channels, Quantum Interference Channels,quantum Broadcast Channels And Quantum Relay Channels.  A Quantum Model For A Communication Channel Describes More Accurately Thechannel's Ability To Transmit Information. By Using Physically Faithful Modelsfor The Channel Outputs And The Detection Procedure, We Obtain Bettercommunication Rates Than Would Be Possible Using A Classical Strategy. In Thisthesis, We Are Interested In The Transmission Of Classical Information, So Werestrict Our Attention To The Study Of Classical Quantum Channels. These Arechannels With Classical Inputs And Quantum Outputs, And So The Coding Theoremswe Present Will Use Classical Encoding And Quantum Decoding. We Study Theasymptotic Regime Where Many Copies Of The Channel Are Used In Parallel, Andthe Uses Are Assumed To Be Independent. In This Context, We Can Exploitinformation Theoretic Techniques To Calculate The Maximum Rates For Error Freecommunication For Any Channel, Given The Statistics Of The Noise On Thatchannel. These Theoretical Bounds Can Be Used As A Benchmark To Evaluate Therates Achieved By Practical Communication Protocols.  Most Of The Results In This Thesis Consider Classical Quantum Channels Withfinite Dimensional Output Systems, Which Are Analogous To Classical Discretememoryless Channels. In The Last Chapter, We Will Show Some Applications Of Ourresults To A Practical Optical Communication Scenario, In Which The Informationis Encoded In Continuous Quantum Degrees Of Freedom, Which Are Analogous Toclassical Channels With Gaussian Noise.;Ivan Savov;quant-ph;"Ph.D. Thesis, McGill University, School of Computer Science, July

One Way To Do So Is Throughcompositional Models, Which Are Formed By Combining Blocks Consisting Ofsimpler Models. One Can Increase The Complexity Of The Compositional Model Byeither Stacking More Blocks Or By Using A Not So Simple Model As A Buildingblock. This Thesis Is An Example Of The Latter. One First Aim Is To Expand Thechoice Of Bayesian Nonparametric  Bnp  Blocks For Constructing Tractablecompositional Models. So Far, Most Of The Models That Have A Bayesiannonparametric Component Use A Dirichlet Process Or A Pitman Yor Process Becauseof The Availability Of Tractable And Compact Representations. This Thesis Showshow To Overcome Certain Intractabilities In Order To Obtain Analogous Compactrepresentations For The Class Of Poisson Kingman Priors Which Includes Thedirichlet And Pitman Yor Processes.  A Major Impediment To The Widespread Use Of Bayesian Nonparametric Buildingblocks Is That Inference Is Often Costly, Intractable Or Difficult To Carryout. This Is An Active Research Area Since Dealing With The Model's Infinitedimensional Component Forbids The Direct Use Of Standard Simulation Basedmethods. The Main Contribution Of This Thesis Is A Variety Of Inference Schemesthat Tackle This Problem  Markov Chain Monte Carlo And Sequential Monte Carlomethods, Which Are Exact Inference Schemes Since They Target The Trueposterior. The Contributions Of This Thesis, In A Larger Context, Providegeneral Purpose Exact Inference Schemes In The Flavour Or Probabilisticprogramming  The User Is Able To Choose From A Variety Of Models, Focusing Onlyon The Modelling Part.

While Technologicaldevelopments Have Paved The Way For The Realization Of Such Futuristic Systems,we Have A Limited Grasp On How To Coordinate The Individual Components Toachieve The Desired Global Objective. This Thesis Deals With The Analysis Andcoordination Of Large Scale Systems Without The Need Of A Centralizedauthority.

This Thesis Provides One For Those Infelicities That Occurwhen A Pragmatic Inference Is Cancelled.  Our Contribution Assumes The Existence Of A Finer Grained Taxonomy Withrespect To Pragmatic Inferences. It Is Shown That If One Wants To Account Forthe Natural Language Expressiveness, One Should Distinguish Between Pragmaticinferences That Are Felicitous To Defeat And Pragmatic Inferences That Areinfelicitously Defeasible. Thus, It Is Shown That One Should Consider At Leastthree Types Of Information  Indefeasible, Felicitously Defeasible, Andinfelicitously Defeasible. The Cancellation Of The Last Of These Determines Thepragmatic Infelicities.  A New Formalism Has Been Devised To Accommodate The Three Levels Ofinformation, Called ``stratified Logic''.

I Show That To Succeed Using Aqc,the Hamiltonian Involved Must Have Local Structure, Which Leads To A Resultabout Eigenvalue Gaps From Information Theory. I Also Improve Results Aboutsimulating Quantum Circuits With Aqc. Second, I Look At Classically Simulatingtime Evolution With Local Hamiltonians And Finding Their Ground Stateproperties. I Give A Numerical Method For Finding The Ground State Oftranslationally Invariant Hamiltonians On An Infinite Tree. This Method Isbased On Imaginary Time Evolution Within The Matrix Product State Ansatz, Anduses A New Method For Bringing The State Back To The Ansatz After Eachimaginary Time Step. I Then Use It To Investigate The Phase Transition In Thetransverse Field Ising Model On The Bethe Lattice. Third, I Focus On Locallyconstrained Quantum Problems Local Hamiltonian And Quantum Satisfiability Andprove Several New Results About Their Complexity. Finally, I Define Ahamiltonian Quantum Cellular Automaton, A Continuous Time Model Of Computationwhich Doesn't Require Control During The Computation Process, Only Preparationof Product Initial States. I Construct Two Of These, Showing That Timeevolution With A Simple, Local, Translationally Invariant And Time Independenthamiltonian Can Be Used To Simulate Quantum Circuits.;Daniel Nagaj;quant-ph;Ph.D. Thesis, June 2008, MIT, 176 pages;http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.2117v1.pdf;./files/LocalHamiltoniansInQuantumComputation.pdf

Thisnaturally Leads To ""unitary Circuit Models"", Which Are Models Of Computation Inwhich Unitary Operators Are Expressed As A Product Of ""elementary"" Unitarytransformations. However, Unitary Transformations Can Also Be Effected As Acomposition Of Operations Which Are Not All Unitary Themselves  The ""one Waymeasurement Model"" Is One Such Model Of Quantum Computation.  In This Thesis, We Examine The Relationship Between Representations Ofunitary Operators And Decompositions Of Those Operators In The One Waymeasurement Model. In Particular, We Consider Different Circumstances Underwhich A Procedure In The One Way Measurement Model Can Be Described Assimulating A Unitary Circuit, By Considering The Combinatorial Structures Whichare Common To Unitary Circuits And Two Simple Constructions Of One Way Basedprocedures. These Structures Lead To A Characterization Of The One Waymeasurement Patterns Which Arise From These Constructions, Which Can Then Berelated To Efficiently Testable Properties Of Graphs. We Also Consider Howthese Characterizations Provide Automatic Techniques For Obtaining Completemeasurement Based Decompositions, From Unitary Transformations Which Arespecified By Operator Expressions Bearing A Formal Resemblance To Pathintegrals. These Techniques Are Presented As A Possible Means To Devise Newalgorithms In The One Way Measurement Model, Independently Of Algorithms In Theunitary Circuit Model.";Jonathan Robert Niel de Beaudrap;quant-ph;"Ph.D. thesis in Combinatorics and Optimization. 199 pages main text,

Utilizing The Resources Of Quantum Physics,superposition Of States And Entanglement, Could Furnish An Exponential Gain Incomputing Time. A Simulation Using Such Resources Is Called A Quantumsimulation. The Advantage Of Quantum Simulations Over Classical Ones Is Wellestablished At The Theoretical, I.e. Software Level. Their Practical Benefitrequires Their Implementation On A Quantum Hardware. The Quantum Computer, I.e.the Universal One  See Below , Has Not Seen The Light Of Day Yet, But Theefforts In This Direction Are Both Growing And Diverse. Also, Quantumsimulation Has Already Been Illustrated By Numerous Experimental Proofs Ofprinciple, Thanks Too Small Size And Specific Task Quantum Computers Orsimulators. Quantum Walks Are Particularly Studied Quantum Simulation Schemes,being Elementary Bricks To Conceive Any Quantum Algorithm, I.e. To Achieveso Called Universal Quantum Computation.  The Present Thesis Is A Step More Towards A Simulation Of Quantum Fieldtheories Based On Discrete Time Quantum Walks  Dtqws .

Simulating A Quantum System Classically Is Almostimpossible Beyond A Certain System Size Whereas A Controllable Quantum Systeminherently Has The Resources And Computing Space To Simulate Another System.analog Quantum Simulation Is One Of The Ways Of Quantum Simulation Throughwhich A Known System Mimics An Unknown System. A Key Aspect Of This Is Theability To Generate The Target Hamiltonian Using Control Operations Which Isreferred To As Hamiltonian Engineering. One Way Of Doing This Is To Apply Pulsesequences Over A Length Of Time Such That The Average Hamiltonian Over Thisperiod Is The Desired One. In This Thesis, We Discuss The Method Of Filteredhamiltonian Engineering Which Works In A Similar Fashion. Using This Technique,we Create A Star Topology From A General Network Of Spins.  Quantum Communication Between Two Parties Is An Important Task For Itsapplications In Information Theory As Well As For Its Use In A Quantumcomputer. A Typical Solution To This Is Using Teleportation Through The Meansof Shared Entangled Qubits. Teleportation Is Not Ideal For Short Rangecommunication Such As Between Two Units In A Quantum Computer. It Has Beenshown That Information Can Be Transported From One Node Of A Quantum Spinnetwork To Another By Natural Evolution Of The System Over Time. Such Networksare Better Suited For Solid State Based Computing Architectures As Well As Forshort Range Communication. The Hamiltonian That Permits Such Transport Howeverplaces Stringent Requirements On The Parameters Of The Network. Whileindividual Control Of Spins Cannot Be Avoided In Most Cases, Excess Control Canintroduce Noise. In This Thesis, We Work On A Few Models Of Spin Networks Thatpermit Information Transport With Minimal Requirements On The Parameters Of Thenetwork.;Ieshan Vaidya;quant-ph;0;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02752v1.pdf;./files/HamiltonianEngineeringInQuantumSpinNetworks.pdf

Surfgen Then Determines,for This Surface, The Minkowski Functionals Which Provide Us With An Excellentdiagnostic Of Three Dimensional Shapes Of Clusters, Superclusters And Voids.surfgen Is Applied To N Body Simulations, Mock Galaxy Catalogues As Well As Togalaxies In The Las Campanas Redshift Survey. In All Cases The Morphology Ofindividual Superclusters And Voids Is Determined And The Connectedness Of Thecosmic Web Is Assessed By Means Of The Genus Curve And Percolation Analysis.

Systemsthat Support Such Representations Usually Depend On The Implementation Of Anintensional View Of The Terms Of Some Variant Of The Typed Lambda Calculus.various Notations Have Been Proposed For Lambda Terms To Explicitly Treatsubstitutions As Basis For Realizing Such Implementations. There Are, However,several Choices In The Actual Reduction Strategies. The Most Common Strategyutilizes Such Notations Only Implicitly Via An Incremental Use Of Environments.this Approach Does Not Allow The Smaller Substitution Steps To Be Intermingledwith Other Operations Of Interest On Lambda Terms. However, A Naive Strategyexplicitly Using Such Notations Can Also Be Costly  Each Use Of Thesubstitution Propagation Rules Causes The Creation Of A New Structure On Theheap That Is Often Discarded In The Immediately Following Step.

We Alsoshow That The Two Loop Contributions To Certain Higher Derivative Operators Not Involved In Beta  Have Divergent Momentum Scale Expansions For Sharpcutoff, But The Smooth Exponential Cutoff Gives Convergent Derivativeexpansions For All Such Operators With Any Number Of Derivatives.

The Discriminant Of This Form Can Be Viewed Asthe Classical Arf Invariant $\omega_1$ Of The Original Form, And The Hasse Wittinvariant Of This Form Gives Rise To A `secondary' Arf Invariant $\omega_2$,which Is Defined On The Kernel Of $\omega_1$.

By Doing A Numerical Comparison With Their Results We Find That Theduality Between Gluon Amplitudes And Wilson Loops Is Preserved.

Both Paradigms Rely On Computing Over A Subset Of Data Items Instead Ofcomputing Over The Entire Dataset, But They Differ In Their Means For Skippingparts Of The Computation.

In Thefirst, We Discuss The Task Of Coin Tossing, Principally In Order To Highlightthe Effect Different Physical Theories Have On Security In A Straightforwardmanner, But, Also, To Introduce A New Protocol For Non Relativistic Strong Cointossing. This Protocol Matches The Security Of The Best Protocol Known To Datewhile Using A Conceptually Different Approach To Achieve The Task.  In The Second Part Variable Bias Coin Tossing Is Introduced. This Is Avariant Of Coin Tossing In Which One Party Secretly Chooses One Of Two Biasedcoins To Toss. It Is Shown That This Can Be Achieved With Unconditionalsecurity For A Specified Range Of Biases, And With Cheat Evident Security Forany Bias. We Also Discuss Two Further Protocols Which Are Conjectured To Beunconditionally Secure For Any Bias.  The Third Section Looks At Other Two Party Secure Computations For Which,prior To Our Work, Protocols And No Go Theorems Were Unknown. We Introduce Ageneral Model For Such Computations, And Show That, Within This Model, A Widerange Of Functions Are Impossible To Compute Securely. We Give Explicitcheating Attacks For Such Functions.  In The Final Chapter We Discuss The Task Of Expanding A Private Randomstring, While Dropping The Usual Assumption That The Protocol's User Trusts Herdevices. Instead We Assume That All Quantum Devices Are Supplied By Anarbitrarily Malicious Adversary. We Give Two Protocols That We Conjecturesecurely Perform This Task. The First Allows A Private Random String To Beexpanded By A Finite Amount, While The Second Generates An Arbitrarily Largeexpansion Of Such A String.;Roger Colbeck;quant-ph;"The idea of using Bell inequalities to generate secure private

In This Thesis We Introduce New Models Of Quantumcomputation To Study The Emergence Of Quantum Speed Up In Quantum Computeralgorithms.  Our First Contribution Is A Formalism Of Restricted Quantum Operations, Namednormalizer Circuit Formalism, Based On Algebraic Extensions Of The Qubitclifford Gates  Cnot, Hadamard And $\pi 4$ Phase Gates   A Normalizer Circuitconsists Of Quantum Fourier Transforms  Qfts , Automorphism Gates And Quadraticphase Gates Associated To A Set $g$, Which Is Either An Abelian Group Orabelian Hypergroup. Though Clifford Circuits Are Efficiently Classicallysimulable, We Show That Normalizer Circuit Models Encompass Shor's Celebratedfactoring Algorithm And The Quantum Algorithms For Abelian Hidden Subgroupproblems. We Develop Classical Simulation Techniques To Characterize Underwhich Scenarios Normalizer Circuits Provide Quantum Speed Ups. Finally, Wedevise New Quantum Algorithms For Finding Hidden Hyperstructures. The Resultsoffer New Insights Into The Source Of Quantum Speed Ups For Several Algebraicproblems.  Our Second Contribution Is An Algebraic  Group  And Hypergroup Theoretic Framework For Describing Quantum Many Body States And Classically Simulatingquantum Circuits. Our Framework Extends Gottesman's Pauli Stabilizer Formalism Psf , Wherein Quantum States Are Written As Joint Eigenspaces Of Stabilizergroups Of Commuting Pauli Operators  While The Psf Is Valid For Qubit Quditsystems, Our Formalism Can Be Applied To Discrete  And Continuous Variablesystems, Hybrid Settings, And Anyonic Systems. These Results Enlarge The Knownfamilies Of Quantum Processes That Can Be Efficiently Classically Simulated.  This Thesis Also Establishes A Precise Connection Between Shor's Quantumalgorithm And The Stabilizer Formalism, Revealing A Common Mathematicalstructure In Several Quantum Speed Ups And Error Correcting Codes.;Juan Bermejo-Vega;quant-ph;"PhD thesis, Technical University of Munich (2016).

Thesis, We Study Various Backgrounds In Type Iib Supergravitywhich Admit Interpretations In Terms A Dual Field Theory, And Computeproperties Such As Effective Potentials And Spectra, Using Both Holographic Andfield Theoretic Methods. First, We Study The Phase Structure Of Beta Deformedn=4 Sym On S3 At Weak And Strong 't Hooft Coupling. We Compute The One Loopeffective Potential, And Find That At Near Critical Chemical Potential Andsmall Finite Temperature, There Is A Metastable State At The Origin Of Modulispace. We Derive The Gravitational Background Describing The Theory At Strongcoupling, And By Performing A Probe Brane Calculation, We Find Qualitativeagreement Between The Weak And Strong Coupling Results. Next, We Studygravitational Backgrounds Obtained By Wrapping Nc D5 Color Branes On An S2inside A Cy3 Fold, And Nf D5 Backreacting Flavor Branes On A Non Compacttwo Cycle Inside The Same Cy3 Fold. These Backgrounds Are Believed To Be Dualto Certain Sqcd Like Theories. We Compute How The Spectrum Depends On Thenumber Of Flavors, And Find That The Mass Of The Lightest Scalar Glueballincreases With The Number Of Flavors Until The Point Nf=2nc Is Reached Afterwhich The Opposite Behaviour Is Observed. Finally, We Consider A Class Ofbackgrounds That Exhibit Walking Behaviour, I.e. A Suitably Definedfour Dimensional Gauge Coupling Stays Nearly Constant In An Intermediate Energyregime. The Breaking Of Approximate Scale Invariance Has Been Conjectured Tolead To The Existence Of A Light Scalar In The Spectrum. This So Called Dilatonwould Be The Pseudo Goldstone Boson Of Dilatations. Using Holographictechniques, We Compute The Spectrum And Find A Light State Whose Mass Issuppressed By The Length Of The Walking Region, Suggesting That This Might Bethe Dilaton.;Daniel Elander;hep-th;Ph.D. Thesis. 119 pages. 13 figures;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.1988v1.pdf;./files/AspectsOfGaugeGravityDuality.pdf

Inthis Thesis, We Address The Problem With Two Approaches  Matroidal Networks Andcapacity Regions.  In Our Matroidal Approach, We Prove The Converse Of The Theorem Which Statesthat, If A Network Is Scalar Linearly Solvable Then It Is A Matroidal Networkassociated With A Representable Matroid Over A Finite Field. As A Consequence,we Obtain A Correspondence Between Scalar Linearly Solvable Networks Andrepresentable Matroids Over Finite Fields In The Framework Of Matroidalnetworks. We Prove A Theorem About The Scalar Linear Solvability Of Networksand Field Characteristics. We Provide A Method For Generating Scalar Linearlysolvable Networks That Are Potentially Different From The Networks That Wealready Know Are Scalar Linearly Solvable.  In Our Capacity Region Approach, We Define A Multi Dimensional Object, Calledthe Network Capacity Region, Associated With Networks That Is Analogous To Therate Regions In Information Theory. For The Network Routing Capacity Region, Weshow That The Region Is A Computable Rational Polytope And Provide Exactalgorithms And Approximation Heuristics For Computing The Region. For Thenetwork Linear Coding Capacity Region, We Construct A Computable Rationalpolytope, With Respect To A Given Finite Field, That Inner Bounds The Linearcoding Capacity Region And Provide Exact Algorithms And Approximationheuristics For Computing The Polytope.

The Reason For Introducing Aneffective Approach In The Higgs Physics Is That The Simple Supersymmetricextension Of The Standard Model  The Mssm  Is Known To Have A Tightlyconstrained Higgs Sector, In Particular With A Lightest Higgs Mass Difficult Toraise Without Introducing Some Fine Tuning. Many Specific Expansions  As Thenmssm For Instance  Allow For A Richer Higgs Sector. In This Case However, Theeffective Approach Is Handy Since It Encompasses Many Different Specificultraviolet Completions. We Have Added To The Kahler And Superpotential Of Themssm All Possible Terms Of Dimensions 5 And 6 Including Only Higgs Superfields.the Phenomenology Of The Resulting Higgs Sector Appears To Be Much Richer, Andwe Analyse Our Model In View Of The Latest Lhc Results. On The Other Side,supersymmetry Is Known For Providing A Dark Matter Candidate, So We Have Alsoworked To Improve The Accuracy Of The Computation Of The Relic Density In Themssm. Indeed The Impressive Accuracy On The Experimental Side  Around 6%  Callsfor A Precise Computation Including Radiative Corrections. Those One Loopcomputations Being Rather Long In The Mssm, Thus Often Overlooked, We Have Usedagain The Effective Approach By Introducing New Effective Vertices That Aim Ataccounting For The One Loop Correction. We Show On A Specific Process Neutralinos Annihilation To Muons  The Agreement Between The Effectiveapproach And The Full One Loop Computation.;Guillaume Drieu La Rochelle;hep-ph;PhD Thesis, 187p;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.1227v1.pdf;./files/EffectiveApproachesInAndBeyondTheMssmApplicationsToHiggsPhysicsAndDarkMatterObservables.pdf

In A Completely General Setting And Strictly Positive Temperature, We Presentresults About Large Deviations For Directed Polymers In Random Environment. Weprove Quenched Large Deviations  And Compute The Rate Functions Explicitly  Forthe Exit Point Of The Polymer Chain And The Polymer Chain Itself.  We Also Prove Existence Of The Upper Tail Large Deviation Rate Function Forthe Logarithm Of The Partition Function. In The Case Where The Environmentweights Have Certain Log Gamma Distributions The Computations Are Tractable Andallow Us To Compute The Rate Function Explicitly.  At Zero Temperature, The Polymer Model Is Now Called A Last Passage Model.with A Particular Choice Of Random Weights, The Last Passage Model Has Anequivalent Representation As A Particle System Called Totally Asymmetric Simpleexclusion Process  Tasep . We Prove A Hydrodynamic Limit For The Macroscopicparticle Density And Current For Tasep With Spatially Inhomogeneous Jump Ratesgiven By A Speed Function That May Admit Discontinuities. The Limiting Densityprofiles Are Described With A Variational Formula. This Formula Enables Us Tocompute Explicit Density Profiles Even Though We Have No Information About Theinvariant Distributions Of The Process.

In The Form Of Mathematical Equations, Hypotheses Symmetrically Relateaspects Of The Studied Phenomena. For Computing Predictions, However,deterministic Hypotheses Can Be Abstracted As Functions. We Build Upon Simon'snotion Of Structural Equations In Order To Efficiently Extract The  So Called Causal Ordering Between Variables, Implicit In A Hypothesis Structure  Set Ofmathematical Equations .  We Show How To Process The Hypothesis Predictive Structure Effectivelythrough Original Algorithms For Encoding It Into A Set Of Functionaldependencies  Fd's  And Then Performing Causal Reasoning In Terms Of Acyclicpseudo Transitive Reasoning Over Fd's. Such Reasoning Reveals Important Causaldependencies Implicit In The Hypothesis Predictive Data And Guide Our Synthesisof A Probabilistic Database. Like In The Field Of Graphical Models In Ai, Sucha Probabilistic Database Should Be Normalized So That The Uncertainty Arisenfrom Competing Hypotheses Is Decomposed Into Factors And Propagated Properlyonto Predictive Data By Recovering Its Joint Probability Distribution Through Alossless Join.

As A First Result This Thesis Extends The Originaltheorem To Projection Operators Keeping The Statement Valid For Hamiltonianswith Degenerate Ground Spaces.  Yet The Main Focus Of This Work Lies In Studying The Efficiency Of Quantumcircuit Simulations By Adabatic Quantum Computation. The Standard Hamiltonianconstruction By Kitaev Is Based On A Path Graph Reflecting The $l$ Computationsteps And Influencing The Scaling Of The Necessary Evolution Time By Itsspectral Gap Of $\mathcal{o}\left \frac{1}{l^2}\right $. Aspiring To Animproved Running Time We Generalize Kitaev's Hamiltonian To So Called Standardgraph Hamiltonians Based On Graph Families With A Different Spectral Gap.  In This Generalized Construction The First Two Time Derivatives Of Thehamiltonian And The Fraction Of Initial Vertices Appear As Additionalparameters Of Running Time. In A First Step The Time Derivatives Can Be Provento Be Constant. Expansion Results From Spectral Graph Theory However Impose Atrade Off Between The Spectral Gap And The Fraction Of Initial Vertices As Wellas The Fraction Of Final Vertices Which Corresponds To The Probability Forobtaining The Correct Computational Output. Graphs With Spectral Gap$\mathcal{o}\left \frac{1}{l^k}\right $, $k<2$, Turn Out To Contradict Verylikely, Graphs With $k<1$ Even For Sure At Least One Of The Efficiencycriterias For Running Time, Output Probability Or Hamiltonian Implementation.  The Above Results May Also Be Obstacles For A Possible Quantum Pcp Theorem Incomplexity Theory Claiming The Local Hamiltonian Problem With Constant Gap Tobe Qma Complete Since The Very Same Kitaev Hamiltonian Is Constructed In Theqma Hardness Proof For The Local Hamiltonian Problem.;Friederike Anna Dziemba;quant-ph;Master's Thesis at the Leibniz University of Hanover. 69 pages;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.04708v1.pdf;./files/AdiabaticQuantumComputation.pdf

For A Physical System, The Coherent Superpositionon A Computational Basis Is Different From The Statistical Mixture Of States Inthe Same Basis. Such Coherent Superposition Endows The Possibility Ofgenerating True Random Numbers, Realizing Parallel Computing, And Otherclassically Impossible Tasks Such As Quantum Bernoulli Factory. Considering Asystem That Consists Of Multiple Parts, The Coherent Superposition That Existsnonlocally On Different Systems Is Called Entanglement. By Properlymanipulating Entanglement, It Is Possible To Realize Computation And Simulationtasks That Are Intractable With Classical Means. Investigating Quantumness,coherent Superposition, And Entanglement Can Shed Light On The Original Ofquantum Advantages And Lead To The Design Of New Quantum Protocols.  This Thesis Mainly Focuses On The Interplay Between Quantumness And Twoinformation Tasks, Randomness Generation And Selftesting Quantum Informationprocessing. We Discuss How Quantumness Can Be Used To Generate Randomness Andshow That Randomness Can In Turn Be Used To Quantify Quantumness. In Addition,we Introduce The Bernoulli Factory Problem And Present The Quantum Advantagewith Only Coherence In Both Theory And Experiment.

These Methods Are Then Applied To Systems Ofvarious Degrees Of Complexity, Including Homogeneous And Isotropic Far From Equilibrium Quantum Quenches Dual To Vaidya Spacetimes, To Homogeneous Andanisotropic Finite Temperature States Dual To Anisotropic Black Branegeometries, And To Inhomogeneous And Anisotropic States Of Colliding Walls Ofenergy Dual To Gravitational Shock Wave Collisions In Anti De Sitter Space.

Free Fermions Correspond To A Set Of Two Qubit Gates Known As Matchgates.matchgates Are Classically Simulable When Acting On Nearest Neighbors On Apath, But Universal For Quantum Computing When Acting On Distant Qubits Or Whenswap Gates Are Available. I Generalize These Results In Two Ways. First, I Showthat Swap Is Only One In A Large Family Of Gates That Uplift Matchgates Toquantum Universality. In Fact, I Show That The Set Of All Matchgates Plus Anynonmatchgate Parity Preserving Two Qubit Gate Is Universal, And Interpret Thisfact In Terms Of Local Invariants Of Two Qubit Gates. Second, I Investigate Thepower Of Matchgates In Arbitrary Connectivity Graphs, Showing They Areuniversal On Any Connected Graph Other Than A Path Or A Cycle, And Classicallysimulable On A Cycle. I Also Prove The Same Dichotomy For The Xy Interaction.  Free Bosons Give Rise To A Model Known As Bosonsampling. Bosonsamplingconsists Of  I  Preparing A Fock State Of N Photons,  Ii  Interfering Thesephotons In An M Mode Linear Interferometer, And  Iii  Measuring The Output Inthe Fock Basis. Sampling Approximately From The Resulting Distribution Shouldbe Classically Hard, Under Reasonable Complexity Assumptions.

The Class Of Interest In This Article Is That Of Synchronousparallel Algorithms. For This Class A Behavioural Theory Has Already Beendeveloped By Blass And Gurevich, Which Unfortunately, Though Mathematicallycorrect, Fails To Be Convincing, As It Is Not Intuitively Clear That Thepostulates Really Capture The Essence Of  Synchronous  Parallel Algorithms.  In This Article We Present A Much Simpler  And Presumably More Convincing Set Of Four Postulates For  Synchronous  Parallel Algorithms, Which Are Ratherclose To Those Used In Gurevich's Celebrated Sequential Asm Thesis, I.e.

The Final Step In Getting An Israeli M.d. Is Performing A Year Longinternship In One Of The Hospitals In Israel. Internships Are Decided Upon By Alottery, Which Is Known As ""the Internship Lottery"". In 2014 We Redesigned Thelottery, Replacing It With A More Efficient One. The New Method Is Based Oncalculating A Tentative Lottery, In Which Each Student Has Some Probability Ofgetting To Each Hospital. Then A Computer Program ""trades"" Between Thestudents, Where Trade Is Performed Only If It Is Beneficial To Both Sides. Thistrade Creates Surplus, Which Translates To More Students Getting One Of Theirtop Choices. The Average Student Improved His Place By $0.91$ Seats. The Newmethod Can Improve The Welfare Of Medical Graduates, By Giving Them Moreprobability To Get To One Of Their Top Choices. It Can Be Applied In Internshipmarkets In Other Countries As Well.  This Thesis Presents The Market, The Redesign Process And The New Mechanismwhich Is Now In Use. There Are Two Main Lessons That We Have Learned From Thismarket. The First Is The ""do No Harm"" Principle, Which States That  Almost  Allparticipants Should Prefer The New Mechanism To The Old One. The Second Is Thatnew Approaches Need To Be Used When Dealing With Two Body Problems In Objectassignment. We Focus On The Second Lesson, And Study Two Body Problems In Thecontext Of The Assignment Problem.

Recently, However,several Measurement Procedures Have Been Proposed In Which The Heisenberg Limitseemed To Be Surpassed. This Led To An Extensive Debate Over The Question Howthe Sensitivity Scales With The Physical Resources And The Computationalresources That Are Used In Estimation Procedures. Here, We Reconcile Thephysical Definition Of The Relevant Resources With The Information Theoreticalscaling In Terms Of The Query Complexity Of A Quantum Network.

This Notion Has Been Extensively Utilized In Various Applications.  Yet The Analysis Is Limited To Systems That Are Asynchronous.

Scientists Studying Theseprocesses Have Identified Various Pathways Responsible For Drug Metabolism, Andsignal Transduction, Etc.  Newer Techniques And Speed Improvements Have Resulted In Deeper Knowledgeabout These Pathways, Resulting In Refined Models That Tend To Be Large Andcomplex, Making It Difficult For A Person To Remember All Aspects Of It. Thus,computer Models Are Needed To Analyze Them. We Want To Build Such A System Thatallows Modeling Of Biological Systems And Pathways In Such A Way That We Cananswer Questions About Them.  Many Existing Models Focus On Structural And Or Factoid Questions, Usingsurface Level Knowledge That Does Not Require Understanding The Underlyingmodel. We Believe These Are Not The Kind Of Questions That A Biologist May Asksomeone To Test Their Understanding Of The Biological Processes. We Want Oursystem To Answer The Kind Of Questions A Biologist May Ask. Such Questionsappear In Early College Level Text Books.  Thus The Main Goal Of Our Thesis Is To Develop A System That Allows Us Toencode Knowledge About Biological Pathways And Answer Such Questions About Themdemonstrating Understanding Of The Pathway. To That End, We Develop A Languagethat Will Allow Posing Such Questions And Illustrate The Utility Of Ourframework With Various Applications In The Biological Domain. We Use Someexisting Tools With Modifications To Accomplish Our Goal.

A Natural Question That Arisesin This Context With Respect To Any Such Model Is This   Given A Function F {0,1}^n \to {0,1}, Can We Compute The Optimal Complexityof Computing F In The Computational Model In Question   According To Somedesirable Measure .  A Critical Issue Regarding This Question Is How Exactly Is F Given, Since Amore Elaborate Description Of F Allows The Algorithm To Use More Computationalresources. Among The Possible Representations Are Black Box Access To F  Suchas In Computational Learning Theory , A Representation Of F In The Desiredcomputational Model Or A Representation Of F In Some Other Model. One Mightconjecture That If F Is Given As Its Complete Truth Table  I.e., A List Of F'svalues On Each Of Its 2^n Possible Inputs , The Most Elaborate Descriptionconceivable, Then Any Computational Model Can Be Efficiently Computed, Sincethe Algorithm Computing It Can Run Poly 2^n  Time. Several Recent Studies Showthat This Is Far From The Truth   Some Models Have Efficient And Simplealgorithms That Yield The Desired Result, Others Are Believed To Be Hard, Andfor Some Models This Problem Remains Open.

To That End,we Formally Define A Weakness Of A Statistical Language Model In Terms Of Thelogarithm Of The Total Probability, Ltp, A Term Closely Related To The Standardperplexity Measure Used To Evaluate Statistical Language Models.

This Approach Combinesa Rigorous Formal Semantics For Quantitative Inference Based On Subjectiveweights With Efficient Weight Based Pruning For Constraint Based Systems.

Assuming That Thestate Resulting From The Evaporation Of A Black Hole Is Similar To Avacuum Bounded State, And That The Similarity Between Vacuum Bounded And Rigidbox Problems Extends From 1 To 3 Dimensions, We Apply These Results To Theblack Hole Information Paradox. Under These Assumptions We Conclude That Largeamounts Of Information Cannot Be Emitted In The Final Explosion Of A Blackhole.  We Also Consider Vacuum Bounded States At Very Low Energies And Come To Thesurprising Conclusion That The Entropy Of Such A State Can Be Much Higher Thanthat Of A Rigid Box State With The Same Energy.

It Is Intended Toprovide A User Friendly Introduction To Twistor Actions, Geared Towardsresearchers Or Graduate Students Interested In Learning Something About Theutility, Prospects, And Shortcomings Of This Approach. For Those Alreadyfamiliar With The Twistor Approach, It Should Provide A Condensed Overview Ofthe Literature As Well As Several Novel Results Of Potential Interest. Thiswork Is Based Primarily Upon The Author's D.phil. Thesis. We First Considerfour Dimensional, Maximally Supersymmetric Yang Mills Theory As A Gauge Theoryin Twistor Space. We Focus On The Perturbation Theory Associated To Thisaction, Which In An Axial Gauge Leads To The Mhv Formalism. This Allows Us Toefficiently Compute Scattering Amplitudes At Tree Level  And Beyond  In Twistorspace. Other Gauge Theory Observables Such As Local Operators And Nullpolygonal Wilson Loops Can Also Be Formulated Twistorially, Leading To Proofsfor Several Correspondences Between Correlation Functions And Wilson Loops, Aswell As A Recursive Formula For Computing Mixed Wilson Loop   Local Operatorcorrelators. We Then Apply The Twistor Action Approach To General Relativity,using The On Shell Equivalence Between Conformal And Einstein Gravity. This Canbe Extended To N=4 Supersymmetry. The Perturbation Theory Of The Twistor Actionleads To Formulae For The Mhv Amplitude With And Without Cosmological Constant,yields A Candidate For The Einstein Twistor Action, And Induces A Mhv Formalismon Twistor Space. Appendices Include Discussion Of Super Connections Andcoulomb Branch Regularization On Twistor Space.;Tim Adamo;hep-th;"178 pages, 30 figures. Review based on the author's D.Phil. thesis.

Its Second Goal Is To Evaluate The Importance Ofinhomogeneities In The Determination Of Dark Energy Parameters, Whose Realnature Is Still Unknown And For Which The Influence Of Matter Structures Hasbeen Proposed As A Cosmological Alternative. We Start With The Definition Of A""geodesic Lightcone"" Gauge Simplifying Greatly The Study Of Light Propagationin The Universe. We Then Define A Gauge Invariant Average Of Scalars On Thepast Light Cone And Compute The Effect Of Inhomogeneities On The Luminosityflux By Considering Their Power Spectrum Up To Its Non Linear Regime. Theeffect On The Flux Is Negligible Whereas Observables Like The Luminositydistance, Computed At Second Order In Perturbations, Are Much More Affected. Wealso Study The Distance Modulus At The Basis Of The Discovery Of Dark Energyfrom Type Ia Supernovae  Sne . The Average Of This Modulus Is Only Slightlyaffected By Inhomogeneities But Its Variance Sensitively Depends On Them. Theseresults Show, Within Their Hypotheses, That An Alternative To Dark Energy By Aneffect Of Structures Is Impossible But, At The Same Time, Emphasize Theirimportance On The Dispersion Of Data In The Hubble Diagram. The Dominatingphysical Effects Turn Out To Be Peculiar Velocity Of Sne And Weak Lensing. Ourpredictions On The Dispersion Are In Very Good Agreement With First Analysescarried Out So Far To Detect A Signal Of Lensing Among Sne Ia Data And Will Betestable In The Near Future.";Fabien Nugier;astro-ph.CO;220 pages, 35 figures, PhD Thesis;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6542v1.pdf;./files/LightconeAveragingAndPrecisionCosmology.pdf

However, Manual Counting Of These Images Isboth Tiring And Unreliable And Ultimately Very Time Consuming For Biomedicalresearchers. Not Only Does This Slow Down The Overall Research Process, It Alsointroduces Counting Errors Due To A Lack Of Objectivity And Consistencyinherent To The Researchers Own Human Nature.  This Thesis Addresses This Issue By Automatically Determining Infectionindexes Of Macrophages Parasite By Leishmania In Microscopy Images Usingcomputer Vision And Pattern Recognition Methodologies. Initially Images Aresubmitted To A Pre Processing Stage That Consists In A Normalization Ofillumination Conditions. Three Algorithms Are Then Applied In Parallel To Eachimage. Algorithm A Intends To Detect Macrophage Nuclei And Consists Ofsegmentation Via Adaptive Multi Threshold, And Classification Of Resultingregions Using A Set Of Collected Features. Algorithm B Intends To Detectparasites And Is Similar To Algorithm A But The Adaptive Multi Threshold Isparameterized With A Different Constraints Vector. Algorithm C Intends Todetect The Macrophages And Parasites Cytoplasm And Consists Of A Cut Offversion Of The Previous Two Algorithms, Where The Classification Step Isskipped. Regions With Multiple Nuclei Or Parasites Are Processed By A Votingsystem That Employs Both A Support Vector Machine And A Set Of Region Featuresfor Determining The Number Of Objects Present In Each Region. The Previous Voteis Then Taken Into Account As The Number Of Mixtures To Be Used In A Gaussianmixture Model To Decluster The Said Region. Finally Each Parasite Is Assignedto, At Most, A Single Macrophage Using Minimum Euclidean Distance To A Cellnucleus, Thus Quantifying Leishmania Infection Levels.;P.

A Method Is Developed To Compute Analytically Entanglement Measures Ofthree Qubit Pure States. Owing To It Closed Form Expressions Are Presented Forthe Geometric Measure Of Entanglement For Three Qubit States That Are Linearcombinations Of Four Orthogonal Product States. It Turns Out That The Geometricmeasure For These States Has Three Different Expressions Depending On The Rangeof Definition In Parameter Space And The Hilbert Space Of Three Qubits Consistsof Three Different Entangled Regions. The States That Lie On Joint Surfacesseparating Different Entangled Regions, Designated As Shared States, Haveparticularly Interesting Features And Are Dual Quantum Channels For The Perfectteleportation And Superdense Coding [42].  A Powerful Method Is Developed To Compute Analytically Multipartiteentanglement Measures. The Method Uses The Duality Concept And Creates Abijection Between Highly Entangled Quantum States And Their Nearest Separablestates. The Bijection Gives Explicitly The Geometric Entanglement Measure Ofarbitrary Generalized W States Of N Qubits [30, 75]. Additionaly, The Behaviorof The Geometric Entanglement Measure Of Many Qubit W States Is Analyzed And Aninterpolating Formula Is Derived [51].  Generalized Schmidt Decomposition Of Pure Three Qubit States Has Fourpositive And One Complex Coefficients. In Contrast To The Bipartite Case, Theyare Not Arbitrary And The Largest Schmidt Coefficient Restricts Severely Othercoefficients. It Is Derived A Non Strict Inequality Between Three Qubit Schmidtcoefficients, Where The Largest Coefficient Defines The Least Upper Bound Forthe Three Nondiagonal Coefficients Or, Equivalently, The Three Nondiagonalcoefficients Together Define The Greatest Lower Bound For The Largestcoefficient [53].;Levon Tamaryan;quant-ph;PhD thesis, draft, comments and suggestions are welcome;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.5994v2.pdf;./files/GeometricMeasureOfEntanglementAndSchmidtDecompositionOfMultipartiteSystems.pdf

Disordered Systems Are Characterized By A Random Energy Landscapedue To Heterogeneities, Which Remains Fixed On The Time Scales Of The Phenomenaconsidered. I Focus Specifically On Elastic Interfaces In Random Media, Such Aspinned Domain Walls In Ferromagnets Containing Defects, Fluid Contact Lines Onrough Surfaces, Etc. The Goal Is To Understand Static Properties  E.g. Theroughness  Of Such Systems, And Their Dynamics In Response To An Externalforce. The Interface Moves In Avalanches, Triggered At Random Points In Time,separated By Long Periods Of Quiescence. For Magnetic Domain Walls, Thisphenomenon Is Known As Barkhausen Noise. I First Study The Model Of A Particlein A Brownian Random Force Landscape, Applicable To High Dimensionalinterfaces. Its Exact Solution For A Monotonous, But Time Varying Driving Forceis Obtained. This Allows Computing The Joint Distribution Of Avalanche Sizesand Durations, And Their Spatial And Temporal Shape. I Then Generalize Theseresults To A Short Range Correlated Disorder. Using The Functionalrenormalization Group, I Compute The Universal Distributions Of Avalanchesizes, Durations, And Their Average Shape As A Function Of Time.

Thisis Especially True In The Case Of Mobile Systems, Where Multipath Propagationcauses The Received Signal To Be Seriously Degraded. Over The Years, Manytechniques Have Been Proposed To Combat Channel Effects. Two Of The Mostpopular Are Linear Equalisation  Le  And Decision Feedback Equalisation  Dfe .these Methods Offer A Good Compromise Between Performance And Computationalcomplexity. Le And Dfe Are Implemented Using Finite Impulse Response  Fir Filters Whose Frequency Spectrum Approximates The Inverse Of The Channelspectrum Plus Noise. In Mobile Systems, The Equaliser Is Made Adaptable Inorder To Be Able To Respond To The Channel Variations. Adaptability Is Achievedusing Adaptive Fir Filters Whose Coefficients Are Iteratively Updated. Inprinciple, An Infinite Number Of Filter Coefficients Would Be Needed To Achieveperfect Channel Inversion. In Practice, The Number Of Taps Must Be Finite.simulations Show That, In Realistic Scenarios, Making The Equaliser Longer Thana Certain  Undetermined  Number Of Taps Will Not Yield Any Benefit. Moreover,computation And Power Will Be Wasted. In Battery Powered Devices, Like Mobileterminals, It Would Be Desirable To Have The Equaliser Properly Dimensioned.the Equaliser's Optimum Length Strongly Depends On The Particular Scenario, Andas Channel Conditions Vary, This Optimum Is Likely To Vary. This Thesispresents Novel Techniques To Perform Equaliser Length Adjustment. Methods Forthe Le And The Dfe Have Been Developed.

One Well Known Such A Case Is When The Generator Set $s_n$consists Of Block Transpositions. It Should Be Noted That ""the Blocktransposition Distance Of A Permutation"" Is The Distance Of The Permutationfrom The Identity Permutation In The Cayley Graph $\cay$, And ""sorting Apermutation By Block Transpositions"" Is Equivalent To Finding Shortest Paths In$\cay$. The Original Results In Our Thesis Concern The Lower And Upper Boundson The Block Transpositions Diameter Of $\sym_n$ With Respect To $s_n$ And Theautomorphism Group $\aut \cay $. A Significant Contribution Is To Show How Fromthe Toric Equivalence Can Be Obtained Bijective Maps On $\sym_n$ That We Call\emph{toric Maps}. Using The Properties Of The Toric Maps, We Discuss The Roleof The Invariance Principle Of The Block Transposition Distance Within Toricclasses In The Proof Of The Eriksson Bound.

At The Individuallevel, Unemployment Often Has A Detrimental Impact On People's Well Being Andhealth. At The National Level, High Employment Is One Of The Central Goals Ofany Economic Policy, Due To Its Close Association With National Prosperity. Themain Goal Of This Thesis Is To Highlight The Need For Frameworks That Take Intoaccount The Complex Structure Of Labor Market Interactions. In Particular, Weexplore The Benefits Of Leveraging Tools From Computational Social Science,network Science, And Data Driven Theories To Measure The Flow Of Opportunitiesand Information In The Context Of The Labor Market. First, We Investigate Ourkey Hypothesis, Which Is That Opportunity Information Flow Through Weak Ties,and This Is A Key Determinant Of The Length Of Unemployment. We Then Extend Theidea Of Opportunity Information Flow To Clusters Of Other Economic Activities,where We Expect The Flow Within Clusters Of Related Activities To Be Higherthan Within Isolated Activities. This Captures The Intuition That Withinrelated Activities There Are More ""capitals"" Involved And That Such Activitiesrequire Similar ""capabilities."" Therefore, More Extensive Clusters Of Economicactivities Should Generate Greater Growth Through Exploiting The Greater Flowof Opportunities And Information. We Quantify The Opportunity Information Flowusing A Complexity Measure Of Two Economic Activities  I.e.

In Doing So, Ihope To Provide A Historic Context For The Original Result, As Well As Anoutlook On The Future Of Technology Derived From These Newer Developments. Anemphasis Is Made In Each Section To Provide A Broader Conceptual Framework Forunderstanding The Consequences Of Each Result In Light Of The Others. Thisframework Is Intended To Be Comprehensible Even Without A Deep Understanding Ofthe Topics Themselves.  The First Three Chapters Focus More Closely On The Bosonsampling Resultitself, Seeking To Understand The Computational Complexity Aspects Of Passivelinear Optical Networks, And What Consequences This May Have. Some Effort Isspent Discussing A Number Of Issues Inherent In The Bosonsampling Problem Thatlimit The Scope Of Its Applicability, And That Are Still Active Topics Ofresearch. Finally, We Describe Two Other Linear Optical Settings That Inheritthe Same Complexity As Bosonsampling. The Final Chapters Focus On How Anintuitive Understanding Of Bosonsampling Has Led To Developments In Opticalmetrology And Other Closely Related Fields. These Developments Suggest Theexciting Possibility That Quantum Sensors May Be Viable In The Next Few Yearswith Only Marginal Improvements In Technology.

Recentapproaches Have Applied The Concept Of 'guilty By Association' To Investigatethe Association Between A Disease Phenotype And Its Causative Genes, Whichmeans That Candidate Genes With Similar Characteristics As Known Disease Genesare More Likely To Be Associated With Diseases.

The Bestformal Way To Quantify It, Is The Methods That We Call Entanglement Measures Orentanglement Monotones.

Quantum Fisher Information  Qfi  Is A Valuethat Could Be Used In Situations Where Phase Sensitivity Is Important And Thisconcept Is Expected To Be The Quantum Version Of The Mentioned Inftrastructurefor Quantum Systems. Qfi Cannot Be Defined As An Entaglement Measure Ormonotone. In The Scope Of This Thesis, A New Optimization Technique Is Proposedfor Optimizing Qfi And Thanks To This Optimization Method, The Orderingrelation Between Qfi And Entanglement Measures Is Studied. Based On The Studiesmade In The Area Of Quantum State Ordering, New And Interesting Analysisresults Are Found And Reported. The Main Important And Interesting Resultachieved Is That For Two Qubit Quantum States, Qfi Maximized Under Localoperation And Classical Communication Has An Interesting Ordering Relation Withentanglement Measures Especially With Relative Entropy Of Entanglement.

However,unlike Term Rewriting, Rewriting String Diagrams Results In Shorter Equationalproofs, Because The String Diagrammatic Representation Allows Us To Formallyestablish Equalities Modulo Any Rewrite Steps Which Follow From The Monoidalstructure.  Manipulating String Diagrams By Hand Is A Time Consuming And Error Proneprocess, Especially For Large String Diagrams. This Can Be Ameliorated By Usingsoftware Proof Assistants, Such As Quantomatic.  However, Reasoning About Concrete String Diagrams May Be Limiting And In Somescenarios It Is Necessary To Reason About Entire  Infinite  Families Of Stringdiagrams. When Doing So, We Face The Same Problems As For Manipulating Concretestring Diagrams, But In Addition, We Risk Making Further Mistakes If We Are Notprecise Enough About The Way We Represent  Infinite  Families Of Stringdiagrams.  The Primary Goal Of This Thesis Is To Design A Mathematical Framework Forequational Reasoning About Infinite Families Of String Diagrams Which Isamenable To Computer Automation. We Will Be Working With Context Free Familiesof String Diagrams And We Will Represent Them Using Context Free Graphgrammars.

This Thesis Deals With The Intersection Of Learning Multiple Tasksand Learning Multiple Languages In The Context Of Natural Language Processing Nlp , Which Can Be Defined As The Study Of Computational Processing Of Humanlanguage. Although These Two Types Of Learning May Seem Different On Thesurface, We Will See That They Share Many Similarities.  The Traditional Approach In Nlp Is To Consider A Single Task For A Singlelanguage At A Time. However, Recent Advances Allow For Broadening Thisapproach, By Considering Data For Multiple Tasks And Languages Simultaneously.this Is An Important Approach To Explore Further As The Key To Improving Thereliability Of Nlp, Especially For Low Resource Languages, Is To Take Advantageof All Relevant Data Whenever Possible. In Doing So, The Hope Is That In Thelong Term, Low Resource Languages Can Benefit From The Advances Made In Nlpwhich Are Currently To A Large Extent Reserved For High Resource Languages.this, In Turn, May Then Have Positive Consequences For, E.g., Languagepreservation, As Speakers Of Minority Languages Will Have A Lower Degree Ofpressure To Using High Resource Languages.

However, The Few Proposed Solutions Are Limited To The Problemof Decomposing Solids Described Through Their Boundaries. In This Thesis Westudy The Problem Of Decomposing An Arbitrary Non Manifold Simplicial Complexinto More Regular Components. A Formal Notion Of Decomposition Is Developedusing Combinatorial Topology. The Proposed Decomposition Is Unique, For A Givencomplex, And Is Computable For Complexes Of Any Dimension. A Decompositionalgorithm Is Proposed That Is Linear W.r.t. The Size Of The Input. In Three Orhigher Dimensions A Decomposition Into Manifold Parts Is Not Always Possible.thus, In Higher Dimensions, We Decompose A Non Manifold Into A Decidable Superclass Of Manifolds, That We Call, Initial Quasi Manifolds. We Also Defined Atwo Layered Data Structure, The Extended Winged Data Structure. This Datastructure Is A Dimension Independent Data Structure Conceived To Modelnon Manifolds Through Their Decomposition Into Initial Quasi Manifold Parts.our Two Layered Data Structure Describes The Structure Of The Decomposition Andeach Component Separately. In The Second Layer We Encode The Connectivitystructure Of The Decomposition. We Analyze The Space Requirements Of Theextended Winged Data Structure And Give Algorithms To Build And Navigate It.finally, We Discuss Time Requirements For The Computation Of Topologicalrelations And Show That, For Surfaces And Tetrahedralizations, Embedded In Real3d Space, All Topological Relations Can Be Extracted In Optimal Time.

Their Applicability Is Supported By The Increasingly Widespread Use Ofmodel Based Design  Mbd  Tools. Mbd Enables The Simulation Of Cps Models Inorder To Check For Their Correct Behaviour From The Very Initial Design Phase.the Disadvantage Is That Slfv For Complex Cpss Is An Extremely Time Consumingprocess, Which Typically Requires Several Months Of Simulation.

Nevertheless, There Are Still Limitations That Prevent A Morewidespread Adoption Of Slfv Tools. Firstly, Current Tools Cannot Optimisesimulation Campaigns From Existing Datasets With Collected Scenarios. Secondly,there Are Currently No Methods To Predict The Time Required To Complete Theslfv Process.

The Understanding Of The Dynamical Evolution In The Case Of Long Rangeinteracting Systems Still Represents A Theoretical Challenge.

The Purpose Of The Present Thesis Is To Investigate The Dynamical Propertiesof Systems With Long Range Interactions, Specializing On One Dimensionalmodels. The Appropriate Kinetic Description For These Systems Is The Vlasovequation. A Numerical Simulation Tool For The Vlasov Equation Is Developed.  A Detailed Study Of The Out Of Equilibrium Phase Transition Occuring In Thefree Electron Laser Is Performed And The Transition Is Analyzed With The Helpof Lynden Bell's Theory.  Then, The Presence Of Stretching And Folding In Phase Space For Thehamiltonian Mean Field Model Is Studied And Quantified From The Point Of Viewof Fluid Dynamics. Finally, A System Of Uncoupled Pendula For Which Theasymptotic States Are Similar To The Ones Of The Hamiltonian Mean Field Modelis Introduced. Its Asymptotic Evolution Is Predicted Via Both Lynden Bell'stheory And An Exact Computation. This System Displays A Fast Initial Evolutionsimilar To The Violent Relaxation Found For Interacting Systems.

The First Problem Revolves Around Geometric Spanners. Here, We Have A Set Ofpoints In The Plane And We Want To Connect Them With Straight Line Segments,such That There Is A Path Between Each Pair Of Points That Does Not Make Alarge Detour. If We Achieve This, The Resulting Graph Is Called A Spanner. Wefocus Our Attention On $\theta$ Graphs, Which Are Constructed By Connectingeach Point With Its Nearest Neighbour In A Fixed Number Of Cones. Although Thisconstruction Is Very Straight Forward, It Has Proven Challenging To Fullydetermine The Properties Of The Resulting Graphs. We Show That If Theconstruction Uses 5 Cones, The Resulting Graphs Are Still Spanners. This Wasthe Only Number Of Cones For Which This Question Remained Unanswered. We Alsopresent A Routing Strategy On The Half $\theta_6$ Graph, A Variant Of The Graphwith 6 Cones. We Show That Our Routing Strategy Finds A Path Whose Length Is Atmost A Constant Factor From The Straight Line Distance Between The Endpoints.moreover, We Show That This Routing Strategy Is Optimal.

Wegeneralize Wigner's Causality Bound To The Case Of Non Vanishing Partial Wavemixing. Specifically We Analyze The System Of The Low Energy Interactionsbetween Protons And Neutrons. We Also Analyze Low Energy Scattering For Systemswith Arbitrary Short Range Interactions Plus An Attractive $1 R^{\alpha}$ Tailfor $\alpha\geq2$. In Particular, We Focus On The Case Of $\alpha=6$ And Wederive The Constraints Of Causality And Unitarity Also For These Systems Andfind That The Van Der Waals Length Scale Dominates Over Parameterscharacterizing The Short Distance Physics Of The Interaction. This Separationof Scales Suggests A Separate Universality Class For Physics Characterizinginteractions With An Attractive $1 R^{6}$ Tail.

I Advance The Designof Interferometers Through An Algorithm To Realize An Arbitrary Discreteunitary Transformation On The Combined Spatial And Internal Degrees Of Freedomof Light. This Procedure Effects An Arbitrary $n_{s}n_{p}\times N_{s}n_{p}$unitary Matrix On The State Of Light In $n_{s}$ Spatial And $n_{p}$ Internalmodes.  I Devise An Accurate And Precise Procedure For Characterizing Any Multi Portlinear Optical Interferometer Using One  And Two Photon Interference. Accuracyis Achieved By Estimating And Correcting Systematic Errors That Arise Due Tospatiotemporal And Polarization Mode Mismatch. Enhanced Accuracy And Precisionare Attained By Fitting Experimental Coincidence Data To A Curve Simulatedusing Measured Source Spectra. The Efficacy Of Our Characterization Procedureis Verified By Numerical Simulations.  I Develop Group Theoretic Methods For The Analysis And Simulation Of Linearinterferometers.

It Is Separated In Two Parts According To The Asymptoticproperties Of The Spacetime Under Study. In The First Part, We Investigatescalar And Proca Fields On An Asymptotically Flat Background. For The Procafield, We Obtain A Complete Set Of Equations Of Motion In Higher Dimensionalspherically Symmetric Backgrounds. These Equations Are Solved Numerically, Bothto Compute Hawking Radiation Spectra And Quasi Bound States. In The Formercase, We Carry Out A Precise Study Of The Longitudinal Degrees Of Freedominduced By The Field Mass. This Can Be Used To Improve The Model In The Blackhole Event Generators Currently Used At The Large Hadron Collider. Regardingquasi Bound States, We Find Arbitrarily Long Lived Modes For A Charged Procafield, As Well As For A Charged Scalar Field, In A Reissner Nordstr\""om Blackhole. The Second Part Of This Thesis Presents Research On Superradiantinstabilities Of Scalar And Maxwell Fields On An Asymptotically Anti De Sitterbackground. For The Scalar Case, We Introduce A Charge Coupling Between Thefield And The Background, And Show That Superradiant Instabilities Do Exist Forall $\ell$ Modes, In Higher Dimensions. For The Maxwell Case, We First Proposea General Prescription To Impose Boundary Conditions On The Kerr Anti De Sitterspacetime, And Obtain Two Robin Boundary Conditions. Then These Two Conditionsare Implemented To Study Superradiant Unstable Modes And Vector Clouds. Inparticular, We Find That The New Branch Of Quasinormal Modes May Be Unstable Ina Larger Parameter Space.

Notably, A Satisfactorydescription Of The Confinement Of Gluons Is Not At Our Disposal So Far. In Thisthesis, The Rgz Framework, Designed To Provide A Proper Quantization Of Ymtheories By Taking Into Account The Existence Of The So Called Gribov Copies Isexplored. Successfully Introduced In The Landau Gauge, The Rgz Set Up Does Notextend Easily To Different Gauges. The Main Reason Is That A Clear Formulationof The Analogue Of The Gribov Horizon In The Landau Gauge Is Obstructed Bytechnical Difficulties When More Sophisticated Gauges Are Chosen. Moreover, Thergz Action Breaks Brst Symmetry Explicitly, Making The Task Of Extracting Gaugeinvariant Results Even More Difficult. The Main Goal Of The Present Thesis Isprecisely To Provide A Consistent Framework To Extend The Rgz Action To Gaugesthat Are Connected To Landau Gauge Via A Gauge Parameter. Our Main Result Isthe Reformulation Of The Theory In The Landau Gauge With Appropriate Variablessuch That A Non Perturbative Brst Symmetry Is Constructed. This Symmetrycorresponds To A Deformation Of The Standard Brst Symmetry By Taking Intoaccount Non Perturbative Effects. This Opens A Toolbox Which Allow Us Toexplore What Would Be The Gribov Horizon In Different Gauges As Linearcovariant And Curci Ferrari Gauges. Consistency With Gauge Independence Ofphysical Quantities As Well As The Computation Of The Gluon Propagator In Thesegauges Is Provided. Remarkably, When Lattice Or Functional Methods Results Areavailable, We Verify Very Good Agreement With Our Analytical Proposal Givingsupport That It Could Provide Some Insights About The Non Perturbative Regimeof Ym Theories.

Thisproperty Is A Quantitative Relation Between The Geometry Of The Degeneration Ofa Calabi Yau Variety $x$ And The Monodromy Action On The Cohomology Of $x$  Acalabi Yau Variety $x$ Satisfies The Monodromy Property If Poles Of The Motiviczeta Function $z_{x,\omega} T $ Induce Monodromy Eigenvalues On The Cohomologyof $x$.  In This Thesis, We Focus On $k3$ Surfaces Allowing A Triple Point Free Model,i.e., $k3$ Surfaces Allowing A Strict Normal Crossings Model Such That Threeirreducible Components Of The Special Fiber Never Meet Simultaneously. Crauderand Morrison Classified These Models Into Two Main Classes  So Called Flowerpotdegenerations And Chain Degenerations. This Classification Is Very Precise,which Allows To Use A Combination Of Geometrical And Combinatorial Techniquesto Check The Monodromy Property In Practice.  The First Main Result Is An Explicit Computation Of The Poles Of$z_{x,\omega} T $ For A $k3$ Surface $x$ Allowing A Triple Point Free Model Anda Volume Form $\omega$ On $x$. We Show That The Motivic Zeta Function Can Havemore Than One Pole. This Is In Contrast With Previous Results  So Far, Allcalabi Yau Varieties Known To Satisfy The Monodromy Property Have A Uniquepole. We Prove That $k3$ Surfaces Allowing A Flowerpot Degeneration Satisfy Themonodromy Property. We Also Show That The Monodromy Property Holds For $k3$surfaces With A Certain Chain Degeneration.

In The First Half Of The Work, I Discuss The Hodge Plot Ofcalabi Yau Threefolds Realised As Hypersurfaces In Toric Varieties. Theintricate Structure Of This Plot Is Explained By The Existence Of Certain Websof Elliptic K3 Fibrations. Such Manifolds Arise From Reflexive Polytopes Thatcan Be Cut Into Two Parts Along K3 Slices. Any Two Half Polytopes Over A Givenslice Can Be Combined Into A Reflexive Polytope.

Moving On, I Discuss A Different Type Of Web Bylooking At Smooth $\mathbb{z}_3$ Quotients Of Complete Intersection Calabi Yauthreefolds In Products Of Projective Spaces. In The Second Half Of The Work, Iexplore An Algorithmic Approach To Constructing Heterotic Compactificationswith Holomorphic And Polystable Sums Of Line Bundles Over Complete Intersectioncalabi Yau Threefolds That Admit Freely Acting Discrete Symmetries.

The Line Bundle Construction Allows For A Systematic Computer Searchresulting In A Plethora Of Models With One Or More Pairs Of Higgs Doublets Andno Exotic Fields Charged Under The Standard Model Group. In The Last Part Ofthe Thesis I Focus On The Case Study Of The Tetraquadric Threefold And Addressthe Question Of The Finiteness Of The Class Of Consistent And Physically Viableline Bundle Models On This Manifold.

However, It Requires Balancing The Tradeoff Between Resourceprovisioning And Operational Costs. P2p  Based Solutions Present Severaladvantages, Including The Inherent Scalability, Self Repairing, And Naturalload Distribution Capabilities. They Require Additional Mechanisms To Suit Therequirements Of A Mmog, Such As Backup Solutions To Cope With Peerunreliability And Heterogeneity. We Propose Mechanisms That Integrate P2p Andcloud Computing Combining Their Advantages. Our Techniques Allow Operators Toselect The Ideal Tradeoff Between Performance And Economical Costs.

If This Occurs At Trans Planckian Energies, Itshould Be Well Described By General Relativity. Furthermore, If There Existhidden Extra Dimensions, The Fundamental Planck Mass May Well Be Of The Orderof The Tev And Thus Achievable With Current Or Future Particle Accelerators. Bymodeling The Colliding Particles As Aichelburg Sexl Shock Waves On A Flat,$d$ Dimensional Background, We Devise A Perturbative Framework To Compute Thespace Time Metric In The Future Of The Collision. Then, A Generalisation Ofbondi's Formalism Is Employed To Extract The Gravitational Radiation Andcompute The Inelasticity Of The Collision  The Percentage Of The Initialcentre Of Mass Energy That Is Radiated Away. Using The Axial Symmetry Of Theproblem, We Show That This Information Is Encoded In A Single Function Of Thetransverse Metric Components   The News Function. We Then Unveil A Hiddenconformal Symmetry Which Exists At Each Order In Perturbation Theory And Thusmakes The Problem Effectively Two Dimensional. Moreover, It Allows For Thefactorisation Of The Angular Dependence Of The News Function, I.e.

They Range From Quantumcomputation, Precision Parameter Estimation To The Thermodynamics Ofrelativistic Quantum Systems, As Applied To Cosmology In Particular.  In Chapter 1, We Propose A New Quantum Computational Model, Called The `powerof One Qumode', That Relies Mainly On A Single Mode Photonic Squeezed State. Inparticular, We Show The Amount Of Squeezing Can Quantitatively Relate Theresource Requirements Of Factoring To The Problem Of Finding The Trace Of Largeunitary Matrices, A Result With Consequences For Understanding How Powerfulquantum Computation Really Is. Furthermore, We Can Connect Squeezing To Otherknown Resources Like Precision, Energy, Qudit Dimensionality And Qubit Number,which Is A Useful Stepping Stone To Finding The Resources That Enable Quantumcomputation.  In Chapter 2, We Exploit The Quantum Mechanical Properties Of Photonic Statesfor Use In Precision Parameter Estimation Of General Linear Optical Processes,which Is Useful For A Diverse Number Of Applications, From Characterising Anunknown Process In A Photonic Quantum Computer To Biological Imaging. Weintroduce A Formalism That Quantifies This Improvement In Precision. We Alsoprovide Conditions Under Which One Can Easily Check For Photonic States Thatare Optimal To Use In This Context, Which Is A Potentially Important Result Forfuture Experimental Efforts.  In Chapter 3, We Explore The Connection Between Two Mode Squeezed States,commonly Used In Quantum Optics, And Relativistic Quantum Processes, Inparticular In Cosmology.

Many Algorithms, For Example Grid Based Numerical Pdesolvers, Have To Access All Neighbor Cells Of Each Grid Cell During A Gridtraversal. While The Array Indices Of Neighbors Can Be Stored In A Cell, Theystill Have To Be Computed For Initialization Or When The Grid Is Adaptivelyrefined. A Fast Neighbor Finding Algorithm Can Thus Significantly Improve Theruntime Of Computations On Multidimensional Grids.  In This Thesis, We Show How Neighbors On Many Regular Grids Ordered Byspace Filling Curves Can Be Found In An Average Case Time Complexity Of $o 1 $.in General, This Assumes That The Local Orientation  I.e. A Variable Of Adescribing Grammar  Of The Sfc Inside The Grid Cell Is Known In Advance, Whichcan Be Efficiently Realized During Traversals. Supported Sfcs Include Hilbert,peano And Sierpinski Curves In Arbitrary Dimensions. We Assume That Integerarithmetic Operations Can Be Performed In $o 1 $, I.e. Independent Of The Sizeof The Integer. We Do Not Deal With The Case Of Adaptively Refined Grids Here.however, It Appears That A Generalization Of The Algorithm To Suitable Adaptivegrids Is Possible. To Formulate The Neighbor Finding Algorithm And Prove Itscorrectness And Runtime Properties, A Modeling Framework Is Introduced. Thisframework Extends The Idea Of Vertex Labeling To A Description Using Grammarsand Matrices.

Following A Brief Review Of The Hermitian Onematrix Model, The C= 2 Matrix Model Is Considered. Built From A Matrix Valuedsuperfield This Model Displays Supersymmetry On The Matrix Level. We Stress Theemergence Of A Nicolai Map Of This Model To A Free Hermitian Matrix Model Andstudy Its Diagrammatic Expansion In Detail. Correlation Functions For Quarticpotentials On Arbitrary Genus Are Computed, Reproducing The Stringsusceptibility Of C= 2 Liouville Theory In The Scaling Limit. The Results Maybe Used To Perform A Counting Of Supersymmetric Graphs.  We Then Turn To The Supereigenvalue Model, Today's Only Successful Discreteapproach To 2d Quantum Supergravity. The Model Is Constructed In Asuperconformal Field Theory Formulation By Imposing The Super Virasoroconstraints. The Complete Solution Of The Model Is Given In The Momentdescription, Allowing The Calculation Of The Free Energy And The Multi Loopcorrelators On Arbitrary Genus And For General Potentials. The Solution Ispresented In The Discrete Case And In The Double Scaling Limit. Explicitresults Up To Genus Two Are Stated.  Finally The Supersymmetric Generalization Of The External Field Problem Isaddressed. We State The Discrete Super Miwa Transformations Of Thesupereigenvalue Model On The Eigenvalue And Matrix Level. Properties Ofexternal Supereigenvalue Models Are Discussed, Although The Model Correspondingto The Ordinary Supereigenvalue Model Could Not Be Identified So Far.;Jan C.

As String Quantization On General Backgrounds With Fluxes Isvery Difficult, One Often Uses The Duality At The Level Of Canonical Fields Ofsupergravity And The Corresponding Half Bps Operators In Sym, Since They Bothbelong To The Shortest Multiplets Of The Superconformal Group Su 2,2|4 . Inaddition To Half Bps Operators, There Are Others With Non Renormalizationproperties. One Such Class Of Operators Is The Quarter Bps Operators, Which Aredual To Threshold Bound States Of Elementary Supergravity Excitations. Theirscaling Dimension Is Also Determined By Their Internal Quantum Numbers.extended Superspace Methods Make It Simple To Identify And Remove Descendantpieces From Quarter Bps Candidates. We Also Compute Three Point Functionsinvolving Quarter Bps Operators, And Explain How Their Non Renormalizationtranslates Into Statements About The Dual Supergravity Quantities. But We Cango Beyond Discussing Protected Operators. The Gs Superstring On Ads 5  X S 5 Can Be Quantized Exactly In The Limit Where The Ads 5  Radius R Goes Toinfinity And The R Charge J Scales Like R^2. Bmn States Are Then Dual To Singletrace Operators With Certain Phases Inserted  Bmn Operators . Bmn Operators Areanother Natural Generalization Of Half Bps Operators. The Perturbativeexpansion Of Scaling Dimensions Of Bmn Operators Is In Powers Of Gn J^2.moreover, One Can Do Perturbation Theory Around The Infinite R, J ~ R^2 Limit.both Expansions Have The Same Regime Of Validity In String Theory And In Sym.we Calculate The First 1 R^2 And 1 J Corrections, And Find Complete Agreementbetween The Dual Quantities.;Anton V.

We Use An Abstract Tensor State Model To Evaluate The Invariant,as Per The Construction Of The Bracket Polynomial State Model Used By Louiskauffman To Derive The Jones Polynomial.

Choosing This R Matrix To Yield Therepresentation Of The Braid Generator Ensures That Our Polynomial Invariantwill Also Have Two Variables. We Construct This R Matrix From First Principles.we Have Evaluated The Invariant For Several Critical Link Examples And Numerousother Links Of Special Forms. Throughout, The Assistance Of Mathematica Hasbeen Invoked.  We Observe That The Links Gould Invariant Is Distinct From The Two Variablehomfly Polynomial In That It Detects The Chirality Of Some Links Where Thehomfly Fails.

We Are Interested In Minimal Free Resolutions Of Theseideals  Or Equivalently The Quotients Of The Polynomial Ring By The Ideals Considered As Modules Over The Polynomial Ring. There Is No Simple Method Offinding Such Resolutions But In The Case Of Stanley Reisner Ideals Hochster'sformula And Its Variants Provide A Way To Compute The Betti Numbers Of Theseresolutions.  Even With These Formulae It Is Not In General Possible To Find Especiallyexplicit Or Useful Descriptions Of The Betti Numbers. However We Restrict Ourattention To Those Ideals Which Are Generated By Square Free Monomials Ofdegree 2. The Purpose Of This Is To Associate These Ideals With Graphs. Thisprovides A Link Between Algebraic Objects, The Monomial Ideals, Andcombinatorial Objects, The Graphs. This Correspondence Enables Us Do Define Newnumerical Invariants Of Graphs  The Betti Numbers And Projective Dimension Ofthe Corresponding Graph Ideals.  We Find Explicit Descriptions Of The Betti Numbers And Projective Dimensionsof Cycles And Forests. In The Case Of Forests We Find A Method Of Describingthe Betti Numbers In Terms Of The Betti Numbers Of Subforests. This Also Leadsto A Description Of The Projective Dimension Of A Forests In Terms Of Theprojective Dimensions Of Its Subforests.

These Theories Are Viewed Assymmetric Monoidal Functors From Topological Cobordism Categories Into Thecategory Of Vector Spaces. In Two Dimensions, They Are Classified By Frobeniusalgebras. In Three Dimensions, And Under Certain Conditions, They Areclassified By Modular Categories. These Are Special Kinds Of Categories Inwhich Topological Notions Such As Braidings And Twists Play A Prominent Role.there Is A Powerful Graphical Calculus Available For Working In Suchcategories, Which May Be Regarded As A Generalization Of The Feynman Diagramsmethod Familiar In Physics. This Method Is Introduced And The Necessaryalgebraic Structure Is Graphically Motivated Step By Step.  A Large Subclass Of Two Dimensional Topological Field Theories Can Beobtained From A Lattice Gauge Theory Construction Using Triangulations. Inthese Theories, The Gauge Group Is Finite. This Construction Is Reviewed, Fromboth The Original Algebraic Perspective As Well As Using The Graphical Calculusdeveloped In The Earlier Chapters.  This Finite Gauge Group Toy Model Can Be Defined In All Dimensions, And Has Aclaim To Being The Simplest Non Trivial Quantum Field Theory. We Take Theopportunity To Show Explicitly The Calculation Of The Modular Category Arisingfrom This Model In Three Dimensions, And Compare This Algebraic Data With Thecorresponding Data In Two Dimensions, Computed Both Geometrically And Fromtriangulations. We Use This As An Example To Introduce The Idea Of A Quantumfield Theory As Producing A Tower Of Algebraic Structures, Each Dimensionrelated To The Previous By The Process Of Categorification.;Bruce H.

For That We Introduce A New Kindof Competition Among The Individuals, Using A Modified Verhulst Factor. The Newcompetition Depends On Some Specific Phenotypic Characteristic Of Eachindividual, Which Is Represented By A Pair Of Bitstrings. These Strings Areread In Parallel And Have No Age Structure. In This Way, Each Individual Genomeconsists Of Two Parts.

In Part 1, The Logical And Conceptual Status Of Various Notions Ofinformation Is Assessed. It Is Emphasized That The Everyday Notion Ofinformation Is To Be Firmly Distinguished From The Technical Notions Arising Ininformation Theory; However It Is Maintained That In Both Settings`information' Functions As An Abstract Noun, Hence Does Not Refer To Aparticular Or Substance  The Worth Of This Point Is Illustrated In Applicationto Quantum Teleportation . The Claim That `information Is Physical' Is Assessedand Argued To Face A Destructive Dilemma. Accordingly, The Slogan May Not Beunderstood As An Ontological Claim, But At Best, As A Methodological One.

In Part Ii, Following Some Preliminary Remarks, Two Particularinformation Theoretic Approaches To The Foundations Of Quantum Mechanics Areassessed In Detail. It Is Argued That Zeilinger's  1999  Foundational Principleis Unsuccessful As A Foundational Principle For Quantum Mechanics.

We Present New Methods Of Extracting All Known Link Homology Theoriesdirectly From This Universal Complex, And Determine Its Relative Strength As Alink Invariant By Specifying The Amount Of Information Held Within The Complex.  We Achieve These Goals By Finding A Complex Isomorphism Which Reduces Thecomplex Into One In A Simpler Category.

There Are Two Situations Where Such High Dimensional Features Arise. One Iswhen High Dimensional Measurements Are Available, For Example, Gene Expressiondata Produced By Microarray Techniques. For Computational Or Other Reasons,people May Select Only A Small Subset Of Features When Modelling Such Data, Bylooking At How Relevant The Features Are To Predicting The Response, Based Onsome Measure Such As Correlation With The Response In The Training Data.although It Is Used Very Commonly, This Procedure Will Make The Response Appearmore Predictable Than It Actually Is. In Chapter 2, We Propose A Bayesianmethod To Avoid This Selection Bias, With Application To Naive Bayes Models Andmixture Models.  High Dimensional Features Also Arise When We Consider High Orderinteractions. The Number Of Parameters Will Increase Exponentially With Theorder Considered. In Chapter 3, We Propose A Method For Compressing A Group Ofparameters Into A Single One, By Exploiting The Fact That Many Predictorvariables Derived From High Order Interactions Have The Same Values For All Thetraining Cases.

With This Method, Hyperboloidal Initial Value Problems For The Einsteinequations Can Be Solved In A Scri Fixing General Wave Gauge. To Study Spatialinfinity, We Discuss The Conformal Gauss Gauge And The Reduced Generalconformal Field Equations From A Numerical Point Of View. This Leads Us To Thefirst Numerical Calculation Of The Entire Schwarzschild Kruskal Solutionincluding Spatial, Null And Timelike Infinity And The Domain Close To Thesingularity.

However, No Solid Argumentsupports This Is General. A Class Of Heuristics, Which Includes The Well Knownuc And Guc, Is Introduced And Studied. It Is Shown That Any Heuristic In Thisclass Must Fail If The Clause To Variable Ratio Is Larger Than Some Constant,which Depends On The Heuristic But Is Always Smaller Than The Clusteringthreshold.  The Second Result Concerns The Properties Of Random K Sat At Large Clause Tovariable Ratios. In This Regime, It Is Well Known That The Uniform Distributionof Random Instances Is Dominated By Unsatisfiable Instances. A Generaltechnique  Based On The Replica Method  To Restrict The Distribution Tosatisfiable Instances With Uniform Weight Is Introduced, And Is Used Tocharacterize Their Solutions.
